This provides continuous monitoring of the temperature, salinity, and velocity of the upper ocean, with  data being made publicly available within hours after collection. The array provides 100,000 temperature/salinity profiles and velocity measurements per year distributed over the global oceans at an average of 3-degree spacing. Some floats provide additional bio-geo parameters such as oxygen or chlorophyll. Data collected by Argo floats are publically available in near real-time via the Global Data Assembly Centers (GDACs) in Brest (France) and Monterey (California) after an automated quality control (QC), and in scientifically quality controlled form, delayed mode data, via the GDACs within six months of collection.",\n    "datePublished": "2021-09-10",\n    "license": ["https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"],\n    "keywords": [\n        "float",\n        "global ocean observing system",\n        "ocean circulation",\n        "in-situ",\n        "ocean pressure",\n        "sea water salinity",\n        "sea water temperature",\n        "multi-year",\n        "weather climate and seasonal observation",\n        "global-ocean"\n    ],\n    "publisher": {\n        "@type": "Organization",\n        "name": "SEANOE (SEA scieNtific Open data Edition)",\n        "url": "https://www.seanoe.org/",\n        "disambiguatingDescription": "Sea scientific open data publication",\n        "logo": "https://www.seanoe.org/html/images/seanoe-share.png",\n        "identifier": "https://www.seanoe.org/"\n    },\n    "includedInDataCatalog": {\n        "@type": "DataCatalog",\n        "name": "SEANOE",\n        "url": "https://www.seanoe.org/",\n        "disambiguatingDescription": "Sea scientific open data publication"\n    },\n    "citation": "Argo (2021).

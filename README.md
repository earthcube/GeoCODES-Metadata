This repository contains documentation about the GeoCODES metadata profile (based on the [ESIP Science On Schema.org Recommendations](https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org/blob/master/guides/Dataset.md)), and a web-accessible folder for hand crafted metadata records for indexing in GeoCODES.

The issue tracker in this repository is the place to post issue about GeoCODES metadata problems. This is to record problems identified in metadata content that would have to be fixed by the data provider, or that are related to processing during GeoCODES harvest and indexing

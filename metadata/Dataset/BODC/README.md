# Notes on files


Following our meeting in February and in preparation for our meeting on Monday, we would like to share some examples (attached) of where we have included the depth information, as either a single value or minValue and maxValue, in some of our dataset JSON-LD:

* Moored CTD sensor with depth as a **measured variable** - [1381893.json](./1381893.json)
* Profiling CTD sensor with depth as a **measured variable** - [1172722.json](./1172722.json)
* Moored ADCP with depth as **measured variable** - [1971475.json](./1971475.json) 

* Profiling CTD **sensor with pressure** - [1177530.json](./1177530.json)
* Moored current **meter sensor with no vertical spatial variable** - [1015727.json](./1015727.json)

A significant proportion of our data holdings do not contain a depth measured Variable, 
rather a pressure or height for vertical spatial reference 
(e.g. Profiling CTD sensor with pressure - 1177530.json). A few series don't have a 
vertical spatial measured variable (e.g. Moored current meter sensor with no vertical 
spatial variable - 1015727.json) but we do hold the depth in metadata. We're not sure how to 
include the depth information when depth is not a measured variable and thought this is something we could discuss in the meeting on Monday.

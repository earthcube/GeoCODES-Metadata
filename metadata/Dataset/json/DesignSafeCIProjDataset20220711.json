    "description": "A half-scale seven-story structure (Specimen-1) was tested on the high-performance shake table in the NCREE Tainan Laboratory. The tests aimed to investigate inelastic torsional response under uni-directional seismic excitation due to torsional stiffness irregularity (Series-1A) and unsymmetric damage (i.e. Series-1B with Damage Irregularity). In Series-1A, an unreinforced masonry infill wall was installed in one edge (West) of the first story of the structure, which resulted in high drift demand in the flexible East frame. Series-1B tested a system with damage irregularity caused by torsional response in Series-1A. The test data will be valuable to validate numerical analysis for the specimen as well as to improve seismic assessment for existing buildings subjected to inelastic torsional response.  ** *** description should describe whats actually in the dataset... This dataset contains results from the analysis of two specimens including sensor information and the resulting specimen reports, 45 experiment runs, three model configurations, and a project report. Each experiment event is documented by raw and processed csv tabular data [what are the fields in the tables????], video of the experiment, and GM acceleration and displacment data in csv tables. ",

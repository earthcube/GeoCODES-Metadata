  "description": "This project publishes the results of cyclic direct simple shear tests performed at  George Washington University (GWU) to characterize the stress-strain-strength response of Ottawa F-65 sand. This data along with the results of the cyclic torsional shear tests conducted at Kyoto University for LEAP-Asia-2018, and the results of the monotonic and cyclic triaxial tests conducted at GWU for LEAP-2015 and LEAP-2017 are provided to the numerical simulation teams who participate in the LEAP-Asia-2018 and LEAP-RPI-2019 prediction exercises. The numerical simulation teams use these results to calibrate the constitutive models.",

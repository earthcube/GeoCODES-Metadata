    "description": "information from hydrologic observation sites with data served by the USGS, provides access to water-resources data collected at approximately 1.9 million sites in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Data are provided in the legacy RDB (tab-delimited) format, as well as in a Google Maps and Google Earth friendly formats. Provides access to sites with real-time or recent surface-water, groundwater,or water-quality data, as well as descriptive site information for all sites with links to all available water data for individual sites. Data for sites might include: 1. iv - Instantaneous values (time-series measurements typically recorded by automated equipment at frequent intervals (e.g., hourly); 2. uv - Unit values (alias for iv); 3. rt - Real-time data (alias for iv). Note: use of rv does not restrict time-series data to only those with real-time data; 4. dv - Daily values (once daily measurements or summarized information for a particular day, such as daily maximum, minimum and mean); 5. pk - Peak measurements of water levels and streamflow for surface water sites (such as during floods, may be either an automated or a manual measurement); 6. sv - Site visits (irregular manual surface water measurements, excluding peak measurements); 7. gw - Groundwater levels measured at irregular, discrete intervals. For recorded, time series groundwater levels, use iv or id.; 8. qw - Water-quality data from discrete sampling events and analyzed in the field or in a laboratory. For recorded time series water-quality data, use iv or id.; 9. id - Historical instantaneous values (sites in the USGS Instantaneous Data Archive External Link); 10. aw - Sites monitored by the USGS Active Groundwater Level Network External Link; 11. ad - Sites included in USGS Annual Water Data Reports External Link",

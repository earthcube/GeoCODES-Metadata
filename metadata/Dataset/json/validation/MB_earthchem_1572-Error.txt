ACTION-- funder value should be a string (identifier for an agent), a schema:Person, or a schema:Organization.
the fundedItem is just the DOI for the dataset, so this element is not providing any useful information e.g. grant name, grant ID, funding agency.  remove it, or replace 
  "funder": {
    "@type": "MonetaryGrant",
    "fundedItem": {
      "@id": "https://doi.org/10.26022/IEDA/111572"
    }
  }
 with
     "funding": [
        {"@type": "MonetaryGrant"}
    ]
	
	which would only say that the funding was a MonetaryGrant from somewhere...
	
NOTEs-- @id should identify the metadata record, don't use the DOI for the dataset--that identifies the dataset. Suggest somethign like  "@id": "metadata:10.26022/IEDA/111572", or use the internal metadata record identifier from the IEDA database.

Schema looks for 'creator' not 'author'; these are considered conceputally equivalent, and choosing one or the other (i.e. 'creator') is for interoperability.

the distribution/contentUrl gets a landing page, not the actual data, so it should be distribution/url

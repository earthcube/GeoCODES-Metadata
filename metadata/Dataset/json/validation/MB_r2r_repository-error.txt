context should be "@vocab":"http://schema.org"
@id identifies the project/program, not the metdata record. 

the metdata records is about a repository, not a dataset. shouldn't be in dataset index. Dataset is not one of the @type values-- GeoCODES should reject or index repositories as a different resource. 
main entity should be:
    "mainEntity": [
        {
            "@type": "CreativeWork",
            "name": "Repository",
            "url": "http://cor.esipfed.org/ont/earthcube/ECRRO_0000209"
        }
    ],

use of "PropertyValue for identifier is not very useful; I've recommended just using the URI in the geoCODES recommendations.

funder--
replace with 'funding'. This is update to schema based on new schema.org element 
"funding":{
 "@type":"MonetaryGrant",
 "funder": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "Division of Ocean Sciences",
    "alternateName": "OCE",
    "url": "https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=OCE",
    "identifier":  "https://doi.org/10.13039/100000141"
    }
	},
	
	
'category' should be 'keywords'

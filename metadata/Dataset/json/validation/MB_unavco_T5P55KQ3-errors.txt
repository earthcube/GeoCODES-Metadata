latitude and longitude should be numbers, not strings

context should be 
  "@context": {"@vocab":"http://schema.org/"},
  
  notes--
  name is blank-- need a name
  description doesn't actually describe the specific dataset.  there's no way to know what this record actually describes...
  @id is url for dataset, should identifier for metadata record.
  
  citation is a citation for the described dataset, inconsistent with schema.org guidance .
  
  DataDownload link gets landing page to select files, not actual data; should be url,not contentUrl, and have a description of what the link actually gets.
  
  encoding format for distribution should be from registry-- text/csv, but it looks like the data come in a variety of formats  (hatanaka, obs, nav, qc), RINEX Data File. none of these appear to be text/csv ....

    "description": "Abundance and biomass of fish species collected during the day from 1980 to 1989 off the coast of the southeastern United States (Cape Fear, NC to Cape Canaveral, FL). Florida Antillean traps were set on live-bottom reef areas on the continental shelf and upper slope. Florida Antillean traps were rectangular (0.9 m x 1.1 m x 0.6 m; 0.59 m3 volume) and constructed of 38 x 51 mm (1.5 x 2.0 inch) plastic-coated wire mesh. Each trap had one entrance and one bait well (0.13-m diameter, 0.6-m length). Each trap was soaked between 90 and 120 minutes.",

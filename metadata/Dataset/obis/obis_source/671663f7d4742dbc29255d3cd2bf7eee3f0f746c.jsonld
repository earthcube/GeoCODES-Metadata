    "description": "These data were collected over the period 1993-1996 (-7) as part of the CSIRO Fisheries South East Fishery Habitat Ecosystem Study in Australia, on four research cruises of the vessel Southern Surveyor plus ancillary data from commercial vessels. The data were collected by a variety of methods including trawls, sleds, gillnets and fish traps. Related data also collected during this study included acoustics, biological hardparts (otoliths, vertebrae, and spines), current meter data, nutrients, physical oceanographic data, phytoplankton pigments, sediment size, stable isotopes, towed video and zooplankton biomass/counts.\nThis data has been republished (2022-08-29 with additional details of each occurrence where they can be one of three types:  catch composition (counts per taxa and optional aggregated weights by trawl event), catch measurements (length and/or weight) of individual taxa and/or catch specimens and their stored location. The occurrence type is recorded in occurrenceremarks.\n",

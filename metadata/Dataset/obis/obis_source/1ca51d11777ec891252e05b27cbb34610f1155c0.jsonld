    "description": "The Coastal Habitat Invasives Monitoring Program (CHIMP) is aimed at developing effective management policies and identifying the locations at highest risk for marine invasives. To these ends, CHIMP collects information about the current locations, abundance, and characteristics of these species along the shoreline. Monitoring is carried-out by teams of trained volunteers.",

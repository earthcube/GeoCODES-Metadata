    "description": "This dataset is from a paper by Donald J. Reish (1968) on the polychaetous annelids of the Marshall Islands.\nThis report is based upon collections made by the author at Eniwetok, Bikini, and Majuro atolls during the summers of 1956 and 1957. In addition, previous accounts of the polychaetes from the Marshall Islands, largely those reported by Hartman (1954), are incorporated in this study. The object of the field investigations was to prepare a reference collection of polychaetes for the Eniwetok Marine Biological Laboratory.\nVarious names have been employed in the literature for the various islands of Eniwetok Atoll. The names employed by Dawson (1957) and by the Eniwetok Marine Biological Laboratory have been followed. Hartman (1954) used the same names for those of the islands from which she made collections, with two exceptions - Rujoru and Japtan which she called Rujiyoru and Munit.",

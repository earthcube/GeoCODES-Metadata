    "description": "Sea surface planktonic assemblages were sampled using environmental DNA at 1.5° latitudinal increments (from 39.5 to 11.5°S) following the 110°E meridian in the Eastern Indian Ocean to reveal factors structuring eukaryotic diversity. Bioinformatics and analyses were conducted in R version 4.1.1 (R Core Team 2021) and all bioinformatic scripts and matrices/databases are available in the GitHub (https://github.com/wwfoodw/East_Indian_eDNA_Transect). Note that no clustering is used, but Dada2, which runs a model of PCR/sequencing error and then generates lineage specific sequences (called ASVs or zero-radius OTUs). Raw FASTQ sequence data are publicly available in the Short Read Archive under BioProject PRJNA657626.\nThis collection is published as Darwin Core Occurrence, so the event level measurements need to be replicated for every occurrence. Instead of data replication, the event level eMoF data are made available separately at https://www.marine.csiro.au/data/services/obisau/emof_export.cfm?ipt_resource=in2019_v03_edna\nVoyage details (metadata, projects, other datasets either online or as downloads, publications and reports, events, maps etc) can be accessed at https://www.marine.csiro.au/data/trawler/survey_details.cfm?survey=IN2019_V03\nIf this data has been used in any products, please acknowledge with the following: We acknowledge the use of the CSIRO Marine National Facility (https://ror.org/01mae9353) in undertaking this research.\n",

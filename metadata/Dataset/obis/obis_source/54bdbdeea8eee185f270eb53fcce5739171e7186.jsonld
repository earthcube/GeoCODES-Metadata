    "description": "In 1989, a multidisciplinary study coordinated by the Acadia Centre for Estuarine Research (ACER) was carried out on the Starrs Point tidal flat, a macrotidal flat in the Minas Basin. The objectives of this study, the Littoral Investigation of Sediment Properties (LISP), was to examine parameters that might influence the stability of the sediment surface and to monitor atmospheric and oceanographic conditions continuously during a spring-neap tidal cycle. The final project report (Daborn 1991) contains information on bathymetry, sedimentology, (grain size, organic content, suspended particulate matter), oceanography (tides, circulation patterns, temperature and salinity), geomechanics, erodibility, air-sea-land interactions, primary production, and animal-sediment interactions.\nThis resource contains information on fish presented in the final project report in Section 3.11.7: 'Fish Utilization of the Tidal Flat'. \nNOTE: This resource is a small subset of the data and information presented in the final project report.",

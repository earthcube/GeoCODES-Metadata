    "description": "This dataset relates to deployments of pelagic stereo-BRUVS conducted by the University of Western Australia within and to the west of the Bremer Marine Park in February/March 2017. The survey was undertaken to provide a baseline assessment of the pelagic assemblages occurring in the region as part of the NESP Marine Biodiversity Hub Emerging Priorities Project #EP2 (https://www.nespmarine.edu.au/project/ep2-surveying-m\narine-life-canyons-bremer-bay). A total of 791 individuals from 13 taxa were identified.\nField methods followed Bouchet et al. 2015 (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/ES14-00380.\n1/full). A series of pelagic stereo-BRUV deployments (n=100, i.e. 20 sets of 5 rigs) were undertaken within and outside the Bremer AMP between 27th February and 8th March 2017. Camera units soaked for two hours and were set up in a longline configuration that allowed them to drift freely with prevailing currents. The resulting video footage was processed at the University of Western Australia Marine Futures Lab (http://www.meeuwig.org), using standard imagery analysis software (SeaGIS EventMeasure, https://www.seagis.com.au/event.html).\nMetadata and data from http://metadata.imas.utas.edu.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/metadata.show?uuid=a18994fa-2879-4b46-97e4-b399bf847b43",

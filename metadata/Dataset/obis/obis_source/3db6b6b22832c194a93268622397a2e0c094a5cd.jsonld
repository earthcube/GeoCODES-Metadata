    "name": "Zooplankton sampling in the coastal waters of south eastern Tasmania, Australia (2009-2015)",
    "description": "Zooplankton was counted and identified from three sites over the 5-year period. The net used (200 microm Bongo net) was designed to catch meso-zooplankton with an integrated vertical tow through the water column. One net from each of the paired Bongo samples was analysed and the data expressed as numbers per m3. Copepods dominated the zooplankton, with other groups such as salps, krill, appendicularians, cladocerans, chaetognaths and meroplanktonic larvae being seasonally dominant.",

    "description": "A new genus, Limatium gen. n., and two new species, L. pagodula sp. n. and L. aureum sp. n. are described, found on outer slopes of barrier reefs and fringing reefs in the South Pacific. They are rare for cerithiids, which typically occur in large populations. The two new species are represented by 108 specimens sampled over a period of 30 years, only 16 of which were collected alive. Three subadults from the Philippines and Vanuatu likely represent a third species. In addition to their rarity, Limatium species are atypical for cerithiids in their smooth, polished, honey to golden brown shells with distinctive white fascioles extending suture to suture. The radula presents a unique morphology that does not readily suggest an affinity to any of the cerithiid subfamilies. Two live-collected specimens, one of each species and designated as holotypes, were preserved in 95% ethanol and sequenced. Bayesian analysis of partial COI and 16S rDNA sequences demonstrates a placement in the Bittiinae, further extending our morphological concept of the subfamily.",

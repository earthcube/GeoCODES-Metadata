    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nNOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC)\n\nAbstract:\nAs part of the AMAPPS program, the Southeast Fisheries \nScience Center conducted an aerial survey on the \ncontinental shelf waters of the US east coast, from New \nJersey to the Florida Keys. The survey was conducted \nbetween 18 May and 24 June of 2019 aboard a NOAA Twin \nOtter aircraft at an altitude of 600 feet (183 m) and a \nspeed of 110 knots. Survey tracklines were oriented \nperpendicular to the shoreline and latitudinally spaced \n20 \nkm apart. The survey was designed for analysis using \nDistance sampling and a two-team (independent observer) \napproach to correct for perception bias in resulting \nabundance estimates. A portion of the proposed tracklines \noff the southern coast of Georgia was not surveyed due to \nrestricted airspace from military exercises.\n\nPurpose:\nThe main goal of this survey was to assess the distribution \nand abundance of marine mammals and sea turtles in the US \neast coast.\n\nSupplemental information:\nPerpendicular distance to the animal is not publicly \navailable.\n\nThe dataset is accompanied by transect (effort) data \nwhich is provided as a separate file.\nSightings included were detected on-effort by the forward \nteam only; you may request the full dataset and sightings \nincluding opportunistic ones directly to the provider.\n\nEnvironmental Attribute Codes\nBeaufort Sea state\n0 Calm, mirror like seas\n1 Waves &lt;1ft, rippled surface\n2 Small wavelets (&lt;2 ft), no white caps\n3 Large wavelets (&lt;3ft), scattered white caps\n4 Swell 3-4 ft, numerous white caps\n5 Swell &gt;5 ft, many white caps, some spray\n6 Swell &gt;10 ft, white caps everywhere, spray\nCloudCover\n0 Clear\n1 0-25% Cloudy\n2 26-50% Cloudy\n3 51-75% Cloudy\n4 76-100% Cloudy\n5 Overcast\nGlare (Glare intensity)\n0 No Impairment\n1 Slight Impairment\n2 Moderate Impairment\n3 Severe Impairment\nWeather\n0 Clear\n1 Mist\n2 Light Rain\n3 Heavy Rain\nConditions\n0 Poor\n1 Fair\n2 Moderate\n3 Good\n4 Excellent\nHaze\n0 No\n1 Yes\nFog\n0 No\n1 Yes\nSun penetration (Sun pen)\n0 Poor\n1 Fair\n2 Good\n3 Excellent\nTurbidity\n0 Poor\n1 Fair\n2 Good\n3 Excellent",

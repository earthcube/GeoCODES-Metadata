    "description": "Original provider:\nPaolo Luschi\n\nDataset credits:\nData provider\nIslameta Group, Dept. of Biology - University of Pisa\nOriginating data center\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/\">Satellite Tracking and Analysis Tool (STAT)</a>\nProject partner\nCentro Recupero Tartarughe Marine, Acquario di Grosseto (Italy)\n\n\nAbstract:\nVirtually nothing is known of the movements made by the many loggerhead juveniles that spend long periods of the year in the sea in front of the Tuscany coast, Northern Tyrrhenian Sea (central Mediterranean Sea). While it has been supposed that loggerheads frequent this area only during the warmest months and then undertake seasonal migrations towards southern (warmer) waters, the occurrence of such migrations have never been demonstrated. On the other hand, the fact that loggerheads are found in Tuscany waters throughout the year (winter months included) can indicate that the picture is more complex and variable than previously supposed.  The aim is to localize the areas frequented by loggerheads in the Northern Tyrrhenian Sea, to document the occurrence of seasonal migrations and/or to investigate the turtles' fidelity to specific feeding areas.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=90\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

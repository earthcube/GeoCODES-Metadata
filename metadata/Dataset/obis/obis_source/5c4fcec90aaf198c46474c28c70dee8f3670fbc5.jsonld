    "description": "In 1989, field studies of reef corals were undertaken at sixteen stations around Cocos (Keeling) Atoll, Horsburgh Island and North Keeling Island. Stations were selected to encompass the widest possible range of habitats. Coral collections were made at these stations and the specimens were sent to the Australian Institute of Marine Science for further study. Comparisons were also made with corals from other geographic regions and Cocos (Keeling) Islands corals held in other museums. These specimens would later be lodged with the Western Australian Museum.\nNinety nine species of reef corals are recorded from Cocos (Keeling) Atoll in the eastern Indian Ocean. Of this all but twelve are known from Western Australia. Nine species have not previously recorded from the eastern Indian Ocean and three (one being taxonomically doubtful) have not previously been recorded anywhere.\nTaxa have been matched to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS). Data used was downloaded from ALA https://collections.ala.org.au/public/show/dr698 July 2018.",

    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nProtected Species Branch, Northeast Fisheries Science Center, NOAA/NMFS\n\nAbstract:\nThe North Atlantic Right Whale Sighting Survey (NARWSS) is a NOAA Fisheries program which locates and records the seasonal distribution of right whales off the northeastern United States.\n\nPurpose:\nnot provided\n\nSupplemental information:\n2023-02-08: The 2022 data (Oct through Dec) were appended.\n2022-08-31: The 2022 data (Feb through Aug) were appended.\n2022-02-03: The 2021 data were appended.\n2021-06-22: The 2020 data were appended.\n2020-12-30: The 2018-19 data were appended.\n2019-10-30: The date/time of the 2017 data were corrected (initially they were at UTC. Now they are at local time zone as other records are).\n2019-09-13: The 2017 data were appended.\n2017-03-10: Data format was changed and the 2016 data were appended.\n2016-06-09: 2015 Nov-Dec data were appended.\n2016-03-08: 2015 Jan-Aug data were appended.\nThe following two records got the animal count corrected.\n- Right whale 06/03/02 16:58:20 0 -&gt; 3\n- Basking shark 06/20/03 17:52:03 0 =&gt; 1 (dead shark)\n2015-05-06: 2013 winter and 2014 data were appended.\n2015-03-24: A few records had a wrong animal count of zero. The value is replaced with a blank representing species presence only.\n2014-08-11: Sightings originally identified as 'CWDO' and not included in the dataset were reclassified as 'UNCW' (common or white-sided dolphin) and now are included.\n2014-02-27: Data in 2013 Jan through July were appended.\n2013-12-18: The count field for the following two records were updated:\nRight whale 2002-06-03 16:58:20: Null (previously a zero)\nBasking shark 2003-06-20 17:52:03: 1 (previously a zero)\n2013-03-04: Upon provider's request, right whale sightings with all psb_legstage flags except '9' were dropped to avoid potential re-sightings to be mapped.\npsb_legstage, a hidden attribute, is a flag indicating the stage of watch. The value of '9' indicates a final estimate of right whales after the animals were first sighted.\n2013-01-22: 2012 data were appended.\nData format for the 2007-2011 data was changed from the Consortium format to the NEFSC original format.\n2012-09-24: The dataset name was changed from NEFSC Right Whale Survey to NEFSC Right Whale Aerial Survey to distinguish this from the associated vessel survey.\n2012-06-25: Data correction: STDO was classified as Stenella coeruleoalba (previously as Stenella attenuata/frontalis). \n2012-06-20: 2011 data were added. \nData correction 2/8/11: Records with LETU sightings were incorrectly associated with Softshell turtles (ITIS TSN: 173845) and was corrected as leatherback sea turtles (ITIS TSN: 173843)\n\nOther references:\n<a href=\"http://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/publications/crd/crd0905/\">Khan C, Cole TVN, Duley P, Glass AH, Niemeyer M, Christman C. 2009.

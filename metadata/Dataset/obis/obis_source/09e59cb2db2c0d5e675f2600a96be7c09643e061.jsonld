    "description": "The movements, diving behaviour and thermal environment occupied by female olive ridley turtles Lepidochelys olivacea in northern Australia were determined through satellite telemetry, during the post-nesting migration. Satellite-relayed data loggers (SRDLs) were attached to the carapaces of 4 female olive ridley turtles nesting in the Wessel Islands of Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory of Australia (Graham Island: 11° 45’ S, 135° 57’ E and Wunpirri Island: 11° 36’ S, 136° 05’ E)\nData downloaded from IMOS 14-June-2017 from https://portal.aodn.org.au/search?uuid=6bed374a-3e86-4bbb-b8d1-a6bf8e2fa183 and taxonomy matched to WoRMS.",

    "description": "Original provider:\nOceanCare\n\nDataset credits:\nSilvia Frey, OceanCare\n\nAbstract:\nThis dataset comprises the work carried out by OceanCare in the Provencal waters in the Mediterranean Sea between 2001 and 2014. The project was organized as a long-term monitoring project in order to survey cetacean population in these waters which belong to the Pelagos Marine Mammal Sanctuary. Cetacean spatial and temporal distribution has been studied using boat-based surveys.\n\nPurpose:\nOceanCare is a non-profit and non-governmental organization founded in 1989 in Switzerland. The organization is dedicated to the protection of marine mammals and the conservation of the marine environment. The association works at national and international level in the areas of whaling, industrial fishing, environmental changes, seal hunting, dolphin captivity, and cetacean research.\n\nOceanCare has the Special Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations and is a partner of the UNEP/CMS Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS) and a member of the Cetacean Alliance, a not-for-profit network of nine non-governmental organizations committed to preserving marine biodiversity and reducing human impact on cetacean populations. With this cetacean monitoring project OceanCare provided long-term data on cetacean abundance in parts of the Pelagos Marine Mammal Sanctuary in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2015-01-22] Dataset was updated with 2014 data.\n[2014-01-14] Dataset was updated with 2012/13 data.\n[2011-12-13] Dataset was updated with 2011 data.",

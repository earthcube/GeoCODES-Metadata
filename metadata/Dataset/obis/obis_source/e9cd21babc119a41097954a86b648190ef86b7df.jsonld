    "description": "Original provider:\nMarine Conservation Research\n\nDataset credits:\nOliver Boisseau, Marine Conservation Research International\n\nAbstract:\nThe dataset contains all sightings of cetaceans and other megafuana made during the MAPS winter cruise in Jan/Feb 2019 (NMFS permit 14809). When conductiong visual effort, two observers were situated either side of R/V Song of the Whale on an observation platform with an approximate eye-height of 5.5 m above sea-level during daylight hours. The observers scanned the trackline and in front of the vessel using naked eye; 7 x 50 binoculars were used to identify species and estimate group size. During periods of bad weather, observers were stationed on deck with an approximate eye-height of 3.5 m above sea-level.\n\nPurpose:\nThe MAPS (Marine Mammal Passive Acoustics and Spatial Ecology) cruises form part of a BOEM project to describe the distribution and behaviour of deep-diving cetaceans in the offshore waters of North Carolina (NMFS permit 14809). MAPS is a cooperative agreement between the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and the University of North Carolina Wilmington in partnership with Duke University.\n\nSupplemental information:\nEnvironmental attributes were recorded less frequently than the GPS data and not all GPS records get environmental attributes attached.",

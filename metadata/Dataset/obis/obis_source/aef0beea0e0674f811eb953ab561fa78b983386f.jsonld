    "description": "This dataset contains seabird survey and associated environmental conditions data collected in the Chukchi Sea during the 9 August - 3 September 2015 Arctic Marine Biodiversity Observing Network (AMBON) research cruise. Seabirds were surveyed using line transect methods. Seabird observations were recorded directly into a laptop computer using software which logged the geographic coordinates of each sighting. Incidental sightings of marine mammal were also recorded. Supplementary environmental data are included for the beginning of each survey period. The dataset is two comma-separated values (csv) files. The file named dlog_2015_dwc_core.csv contains the count of observed marine birds and mammals by species, their behavior, and the environmental conditions recorded during the surveys for the 2015 research cruise. The file named taxon_codes_2015.csv is an associated taxon code list of the observed species. This dataset was transformed from the native format into a table structure using Darwin Core term names as column names.",

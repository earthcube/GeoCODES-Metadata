    "description": "Survey for lobster larvae - Northumberland Straits. Lobster eggs are laid during the summer months but remain attached to the under surface of the female lobster's tail where they continue to develop for about 11 months. In Northumberland Strait hatching starts about June 1 and continues throughout July and August. When the tiny lobsters emerge from the egg they are about 1/3 of an inch in total length and are known as first-stage lobster larvae. These undergo three successive molts, passing through the second and third stages before reaching the fourth stage. The first three stages bear little resemblance to the adult lobsters but the fourth stages can be easily recognized as a lobster although only Â½ an inch in total length. From the first to the fourth stage the larvae are free-swimming and are usually concentrated at the surface during day-light hours.",

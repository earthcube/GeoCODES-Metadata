    "description": "A rocky shore biodiversity survey along the northern Namibian coast was conducted in January 2014. At each rocky shore three transects were sampled down the shore, on which the numbers and/or percentage cover of macrofaunal species present in quadrats were recorded. A quadrat size 1 m by 0.5 m was used for the sampling. We scored four to five quadrats per transect, covering the highshore (just above high spring tides, i.e., the Littorina zone), upper shore (roughly high neap tide), midshore (midtide), lowshore (low neap tide) and bottom (low spring tides). We always worked at spring tides to ensure we could cover the whole shore, although at times the swell did not allow to get into the lowest shore. Only absence/presence of species recorded within the quadrats is recorded in this data set.",

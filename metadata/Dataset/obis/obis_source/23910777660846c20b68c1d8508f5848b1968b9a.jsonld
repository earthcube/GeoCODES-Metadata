    "description": "Original provider:\nHDR Environmental, Operations and Construction, Inc.\n\nDataset credits:\nThe U.S. Navy Marine Species Monitoring Program\n\nAbstract:\nFeatures in this feature class represent animal sightings recorded during aerial monitoring surveys for marine mammals and sea turtles performed in January, February, and August 2014 in the Hawaii Range Complex (HRC). Aerial surveys were conducted subsequent to two naval training events in HRC. The surveys involved circumnavigation of the island of Kauai in January–February using a ASTAR 350 B2-7 helicopter, and the islands of Oahu, Maui, Molokai, Lanai and Kahoolawe in August using a Bell 206L3 helicopter . The associated training events (Koa Kai and Rim of the Pacific or “RIMPAC”) involved the use of mid-frequency active sonar and, in the case of RIMPAC, explosives. The Koa Kai event took place primarily on the Pacific Missile Range Facility Barking Sands Tactical Underwater Range and Barking Sands Underwater Range Extension between Kauai and Niihau, Hawaii, during 24–31 January 2014. Following the Koa Kai event, shoreline surveys were conducted on 31 January and 5 February. RIMPAC took place during an extended period from 8 July through 2 August 2014 and involved a broader expanse of ocean off the main Hawaiian Islands. The aerial shoreline surveys performed subsequent to RIMPAC circumnavigated the five islands of Oahu, Maui, Molokai, Lanai and Kahoolawe over 4 days on 1 and 4–6 August. All surveys involved looking for stranded or near-stranded marine mammals, and observers documented the positions and behavior of all marine mammals and sea turtles seen within 3 km of shore. The survey platform was a small fixed-wing Aero Commander 500. Work was performed under HDR task order KB26 (IDIQ contract award N62470-10-D-3011, NAVFAC LANT).",

    "description": "Surveys were conducted as part of an assessment of the Macrocystis pyrifera beds on the east coast of Tasmania by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industry Research Organisation (CSIRO) Division of Fisheries seaweed program in the early 1950's. Surveys were conducted because of interest in the Macrocystis beds as a source of alginates. Surveys were done between 1950 and mid 1953. The paper was published in 1954. In 1965, there was a survey of the extent of Macrocystis pyrifera beds in the vicinity of the Mercury Passage, east coast of Tasmania. The 1986 survey was used to establish stock levels. In 1999, aerial s surveys were conducted to establish Macrocystis bed boundaries.\nThe data has been downloaded from https://listdata.thelist.tas.gov.au/opendata/ on March 2020 There are 5 datasets titled Macrocystis pyrifera survey.",

    "description": "The goal of this “BSM-Fiji” campaign, from 7 to 27 May 2007, was to sample algae, sponges and ascidians so as to analyse the region’s biodiversity. Sampling was carried out in the provinces of Bua, Macuata (Vanua Levu Island), Cakaudrauve (Ringgold atolls), Lomaiviti (N’Gau Islands) and Kaduvu.\nThis campaign was part of the CRISP (Coral Reef InitiativeS for the Pacific) program and formed Component 2C2 of the project as\none of the programs designed to foster biodiversity through research on new natural substances of marine origin.",

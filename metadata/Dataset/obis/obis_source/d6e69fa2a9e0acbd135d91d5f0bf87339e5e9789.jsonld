    "description": "This historical collection consists of 150 specimens and it is of particular interest since it is the first to be taken from the waters of the Eastern Mediterranean. The main point of importance brought out by the present investigations is that there are definite signs of an immigration of sponges from the Red Sea and Indian Ocean.",

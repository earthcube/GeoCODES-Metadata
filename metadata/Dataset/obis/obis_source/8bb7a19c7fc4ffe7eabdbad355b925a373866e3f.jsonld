    "description": "This dataset is a combination of two projects monitoring long-term trends in coral reef communities of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) -  NERP TE Project 1.1 Monitoring status and trends of coral reefs of the GBR (AIMS) (see https://eatlas.org.au/data/uuid/1a46774e-a3ac-4982-b08b-94ce1ad8d45c) and NERP TE Project 8.1 Monitoring the ecological effects of the Great Barrier Reef Zoning Plan on mid- and outer-shelf reefs (AIMS) (see https://eatlas.org.au/data/uuid/2cf689a9-2f4e-4658-b838-9bdca45919ea) . Coral cover in percentage has been recorded at the family level. Data accessed 2020-03-20 from  https://apps.aims.gov.au/metadata/view/5a8a4b00-4ade-11dc-8f56-00008a07204e using the two 'Subset of data...' links in the General Links section.",

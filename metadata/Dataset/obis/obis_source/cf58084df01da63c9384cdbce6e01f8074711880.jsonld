    "description": "Original provider:\nSebastien Jaquemet\n\nDataset credits:\nSebastien Jaquemet\n\nAbstract:\nWe investigated the foraging habitats of the\nwinter breeding community of tropical seabirds from\nEuropa Island (Mozambique Channel) in September\n2003. We focused our study on the dominant species of\nthis austral community, the sooty tern (<i>Sterna fuscata</i>),\nthe red-footed booby (<i>Sula sula</i>), and the frigatebirds,\nincluding the great (<i>Fregata minor</i>) and the lesser frigatebirds (<i>F. ariel</i>). We considered the at-sea distribution and abundance of these species in relation to\nchlorophyll concentration, sea surface temperatures,\nsea surface height anomalies, depth of the thermocline,\ndistance to the colony, and presence of surface marine\npredators, flying fishes and other seabirds. Although the\nmarine environment where seabirds foraged was oligotrophic,\nit presents the best feeding opportunities for\nseabirds for the area in winter.\nOur study demonstrates\nthat the winter-breeding seabird species of Europa Island\ntend to forage in productive waters in association\nwith other marine predators when possible. Sooty terns\nand frigatebirds were widely distributed in the whole\nstudy area, whereas red-footed boobies were not found\nfarther than 160 km from their colonies and were associated\nwith relatively productive waters. Sooty terns and\nred-footed boobies were aggregated where flying fishes\nwere abundant. The presence of other marine predators\nwas associated with larger multispecies feeding flocks\nthan when no association occurred. Sooty terns, which\nare numerically dominant at Europa and adopted network\nforaging, seem to be catalysts of feeding events, and represented a good target for the other foraging\nspecies, especially frigatebirds. However, when possible,\nfrigatebirds favor association with flocks of red-footed\nboobies.\n\nPurpose:\nWe studied the at-sea distribution and abundance\nof the seabird species that breed during the\naustral winter on Europa Island in relation to physical\nand biological factors. We tested how the different\nspecies distributed themselves within their foraging\nrange and whether specific locations aggregate foraging\nseabirds. We also examine the foraging strategies\nadopted by each species, particularly the importance of\nlocal enhancement on the feeding activity of the seabirds.\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2020-09-30] The following invalid species names were corrected according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS).\nSooty Tern: Sterna fuscata (176894) =&gt; Onychoprion fuscatus (824105)",

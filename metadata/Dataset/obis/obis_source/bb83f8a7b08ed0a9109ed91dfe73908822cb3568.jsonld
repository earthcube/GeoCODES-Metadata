    "description": "A database with more than ten (10) years of information gathering and sampling in different localities of the country is presented. This database contains to date a total of 10.435 records of benthic macroalgae, with locations distributed along the Venezuelan coast. It is a compilation that has been made after the review, to date, of 208 bibliographic references, where a total of 657 species are reported, including 292 synonyms. The records of the Catalog Ficoflora Venezuela come from 500 georeferenced locations, distributed in 12 federal entities. Currently, three (3) special degree projects are also being developed within the framework of this project with the participation of students and teachers from the School of Computing and the School of Biology of the Faculty of Sciences of the Central University of Venezuela.",

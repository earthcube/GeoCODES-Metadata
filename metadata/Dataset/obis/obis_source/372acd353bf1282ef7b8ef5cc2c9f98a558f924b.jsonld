    "description": "The Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management (CZM) established the Marine Invader Monitoring and Information Collaborative (MIMIC) in 2006 to serve as an early detection network for marine invasive species across New England. Their goals are: (1) to find introduced non-native marine species before they spread and/or become established in the ecosystem, (2) to educate the general public about marine invasive species and how to reduce their spread, and (3) to provide data to all interested users.",

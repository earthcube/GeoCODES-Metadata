    "description": "Abundance and biomass of fish species collected during the day from 1983 to 1986 off the coast of the southeastern United States (Cape Fear, NC to Cape Canaveral, FL). Kali poles are \"off-bottom\" longlines, designed to place a large number of baited hooks in close proximity to rugged rocky bottom, while minimizing hangups of the gear in the rocks. The poles are attached to a 91-m (100-yard) treated cotton groundline [6.4 mm (1/4 inch)]. Each pole is 3 m (10 feet) long PVC plastic pipe [25-mm (1-inch diameter), schedule 80] and has 6. Each 91-m (100-yard) polypropylene groundline has 20 poles.",

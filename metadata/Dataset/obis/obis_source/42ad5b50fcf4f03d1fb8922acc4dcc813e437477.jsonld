    "description": "This dataset is a work in progress and will be updated regularly.\nFrom 1986 to 2006, Astrolabe Incorporated, led by Joan Koven, conducted mollusc collections from the North and Great Astrolabe Reef in Kadavu, Fiji. A total of 799 species were identified over collection period.\nIn 2008, Joan Koven donated the entire molluscan collection to the University of the South Pacific (USP) in Suva, Fiji, where it is currently housed in the USP Marine Collection at the School of Marine Studies.\nThis dataset is comprised of the specimens collected and identified by Astrolabe Incorporated.\nPublication of this dataset was funded by the European Union (EU). We are also grateful to GBIF, BID and VertNet for their support in mobilising this dataset, and to the John and Dave Foundation for technical support.",

First samples are dated in 1933 owned by Prof. Steuer, while the other samples are from the Nile area and collected by Dr. Hans Amberg, in 1904. The samples that come from the large district of the Nile prove that the Melosira in Prof. Steuer's material represents  a real phytoplankton component of Nile water and not merely a passive swimming organism.",

    "description": "This report is based on the collections of specimens and data in the Auckland and Campbell Islands in the years 1942-44. Early in 1941, coast-watching stations were established at Port Ross, Carnley Harbour, and Perseverance Harbour, and the personnel of from three to five men at each were relieved once a year. Standing instructions issued by the Navy Office included a recommendation that the men should, in addition to service routine, record general observations on natural phenomena. This report is regarded as of the Cape Expedition which was the war-time code name for parties in the field between 1941 and 1945.\nA small collection of fishes was brought back by the Cape Expedition, 1942-44. The 34 specimens examined belonged to six species all previously recorded from this region, with the expection of Limnicthys rendalli n.sp., which was considered a new species.",

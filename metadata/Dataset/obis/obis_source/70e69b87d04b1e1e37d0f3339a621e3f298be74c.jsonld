    "description": "Original provider:\nLuca Giovagnoli, CetaceanSound.org\n\nDataset credits:\nLuca Giovagnoli, CetaceanSound.org\n\nAbstract:\nResearch on marine mammals was conducted in 1988-2006 and sightings were collected from each ferry on the Adriatic Sea. The lines included: Italy, Yugoslavia, Albania, and Greece. We had 175 sightings in 12 years. For each sighting, we collected: date, time, weather condition, sea position, numbers of animals, kind of animals, depth and so on.\nThis research was conducted to observe and study the biological competition between humans and dolphins (both of them are catching blue fish). All of the data collected was used for my thesis degree at Parma University - Vet Medicine.\n\nPurpose:\nMy whole career has been based on the study of cetaceans and how they are used to communicate. I’ve been studying their language and their ways of hunting and feeding. I started in 1988 with the first Italian work about cetaceans’ distribution in all of the Adriatic Sea. I studied the biological competition between humans and dolphins. Then in 1990, I began studying indigenous populations in the Adriatic Sea. With the group of Electonics directed by Eng. Massimo Azzali (I.R.Pe. M. CNR – Ancona), we worked out many theses about sounds and ultrasound in dolphins’ communication. In particular, we studied the system to prevent dolphins from ending up in fishing nets and the way they have to communicate between different groups. I carried out many research studies in Italy and many European countries, as well as the United States. My interest has been focused in the study of wild and domestic animals, whether by applying conventional veterinary medicine or the homeopathic and natural approach. I decided to create the Organization called Cetaceansound.Org, because I really trust in the opportunity to save dolphins and creatures from the ocean. I’ll keep on working in this field because they represent our future. \n\nSupplemental information:\nData provided to OBIS-SEAMAP are from 1988-2000 and other years of data from this project are currently being worked on.\nErroneous points (i.e., on land or otherwise) were excluded.\n2013-10-31: data were updated to include reformatted time",

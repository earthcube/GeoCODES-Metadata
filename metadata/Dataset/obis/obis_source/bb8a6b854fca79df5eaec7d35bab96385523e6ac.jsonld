    "description": "Hatakejima Experimental Field is located in Tanabe Bay, Wakayama Prefecture, Japan, which is composed of Hatakejima Island and Komarujima Islet, connected to the former in low tide. Hatakejima Island was purchased by Kyoto University and was designated as the ‘Hatakejima Experimental Field’ in 1968. The long-term surveys have been formally conducted on the experimental field since 1969 as the Century of Research Project. In the south coast survey, all intertidal organisms including seaweeds were identified by sight and recorded in the 16 rocks along the southern and western coasts of Hatakejima Island. This dataset is the result of the south coast survey conducted from 1969.",

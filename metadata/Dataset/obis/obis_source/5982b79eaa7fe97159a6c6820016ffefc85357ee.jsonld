    "name": "Preliminary Investigation of Benthonic Foraminiferal Ecology in Tracadie Bay, Prince Edward Island",
    "description": "Data on marine benthonic foraminifera were obtained from samples collected in Tracadie Bay during September 1964. The bay is shallow and undergoes wide diurnal and seasonal temperature and pH changes. Samples were collected from the sediment in water depths from 1.82m to 3.65m. Temperature and pH of sediments were recorded as soon as they reached the surface. Sediments were mixed with alcohol and Rose Bengal for faunal analysis. The samples collected from 1.82m were located in tidal marshes at low tide. The foraminifera results were tabulated as percent living as well as percent of total population. Only species presence is included in this OBIS view. Complete information on sediments in the bay and statistical analysis of samples can be found in the original data report (Bartlett,1965).",

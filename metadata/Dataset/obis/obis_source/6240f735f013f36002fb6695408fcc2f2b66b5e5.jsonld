    "description": "Original provider:\nInternational Fund for Animal Welfare, Song of the Whale Team\n\nDataset credits:\nOliver Boisseau, Marine Conservation Research International\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2020-09-30] The following invalid species names were corrected according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS).\nTurtles: Testudines (173749) =&gt; Testudines (948936)\n\nThe databases from 1993 to 2013 were merged into one dataset. Attributes recorded in these databases may differ.\nSince GPS data would become too huge to effectively visualize online, every 10th record was extracted. All GPS data can be requested.\nEnvironmental attributes were recorded less frequently than the GPS data and not all GPS records get environmental attributes attached.",

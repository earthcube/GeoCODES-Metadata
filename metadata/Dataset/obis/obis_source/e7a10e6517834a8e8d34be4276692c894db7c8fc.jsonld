    "description": "A catch and mark–recapture survey was conducted over 4–6 successive days every month over an 8-month study period between May and December in 2018. A minimum of 15 baited wooden pots enclosed by mesh were used to capture individuals at each study location, with each pot site being sampled twice on each trip. Additional mark–recapture data were obtained from a simultaneous and comparable on-going research program conducted by the DPIRD (Fisheries Research) at Seven Mile Beach between May 2017 and November 2018. Historical data from a previous tagging study between November 2017 and December 2017 conducted by the University of Western Australia (UWA) contributed an additional 1682 tagged individuals.",

    "description": "Original provider:\nObservatoire PELAGIS UMS 3462 University La Rochelle - CNRS\n\nDataset credits:\nObservatoire PELAGIS UMS 3462, University La Rochelle - CNRS\n\nAbstract:\nRegulation (EC) No 812/2004 of 26 April 2004 is intended to assess the incidental catch of cetaceans in fisheries and to reduce bycatch in some fisheries. This regulation requires plans observation on vessels over 15 meters operating in pelagic trawl or large vertical opening in ICES zones VI, VII, VIII and IX, and vessesl over 15 meters operating with set nets in ICES VIa, VI-a,b and VIIIa,b,c and IX.The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (Directorate of Marine Fisheries and Aquaculture - DPMA) is responsible for the implementation of the Regulation for France. An observation program of incidental catches of cetaceans started in 2006 on the French metropolitan coast. The sampling plan provides coverage of 5% of the fishing effort for gillnets over 15 m in area VIII. For pelagic trawlers over 15m, a 5% coverage of the fishing effort has also been planned except for VI, VII and VIII where a coverage of 10% is required from December 1 to March 31.In addition, for vessels under 15m, pilot projects have been implemented by using on board observers. For simple pelagic trawls, a coverage rate of 5% of the fishing effort has been applied. For netters, a 1% coverage of the fishing effort has been targeted.\nThis dataset gathered sightings made during these surveys together, but DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY BYCATCH DATA.\n\nPurpose:\nImplemented  in  1983  in  European  waters,  the  Common\nFishery  Policy  (CFP)  is  the  marine  translation  of  the  Common Agricultural  Policy  (CAP).  Its  goals  are  manifold  including estimating  and  reducing  the  total  incidence of  non-target  species  bycatch.  Since  1992,  the  Habitats  Directive required  bycatch  monitoring  by  European  Union  (EU)  Member States.  In  line  with  commitments  towards  individual  protected\nspecies,  incidental  catches  are  addressed  under  Article  12(4) which  establishes  an  obligation  to  address,  inter  alia,  by-catches:\n‘Member  States  shall  establish  a  system  to  monitor  the  incidental capture  and  killing  of  the  animal  species  listed  in  Annex  IV(a).  In light  of  the  information  gathered,  Member  States  shall  take\nfurther  research  or  conservation  measures  as  required  to  ensure that  incidental  capture  and  killing  does  not  have  a  significant\nimpact  on  the  species  concerned’.\nThe presence of observer on board is a good opportunity to collect data from live animal distribution and relative abundance, and provide additionnal data (considered as data collected on platform of opportunity).\n\nSupplemental information:\nTime and group size of the sightings are not available online. They may be released upon request.",

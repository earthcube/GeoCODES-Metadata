    "description": "The Kittlitz's Murrelet <i>Brachyramphus brevirostris</i> is a bird species of environmental concern, and only 21 confirmed nest locations are published for North America. Drastic population declines are reported in its southern distributional range. This bird is found in subarctic and warmer regions near glaciers, also occurring in Russia. A wider analysis of these nest sites is coming forward, and it appears that these nests are associated with glaciers and volcano slopes. However, this is only an impression based on the small sample of nests.\n\nDataset credit = ArcOD/AOOS",

Stable isotope analysis of skin and eggshell tissue (which reflect foraging areas) will be compared with the oceanographic regions visited during satellite tracking.  Stable isotope values that are consistently different for females in oceanic vs. neritic habitats lend credence to their use to infer post-nesting migratory destinations.  A lack of matching between isotope values (pre-nesting habitat) and satellite tracks (post-nesting habitats) would suggest a) that loggerheads do not exhibit philopatry to foraging regions, or b) that loggerhead habitat use is too flexible to use isotopes in inferring habitat use.  A consistent isotope-telemetry match among individuals would suggest that stable isotopes can be used in lieu of the more expensive satellite telemetry approach to potentially infer foraging grounds. A second focus is to track female turtles that are potentially bycatch in the Gulf of Mexico Reef Fish Fishery bottom longline fishery.

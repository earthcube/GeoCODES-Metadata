    "description": "Original provider:\nNational Marine Mammal Laboratory\n\nDataset credits:\nNational Marine Mammal Laboratory\n\nAbstract:\nVisual surveys for cetaceans were conducted in the Gulf of Alaska in association with a NOAA/Alaska Fisheries Science Center’s pollock stock assessment survey aboard the NOAA ship Miller Freeman from  26 June – 15 July 2003. Standard line-transect methods were used with three observers rotating through two 25x (Big Eye) binocular positions and one recorder on the flying bridge. Survey effort was conducted along the pollock survey transect lines, weather permitting. Additional effort was made while in transit to and from pollock survey waypoints. A total of 2,242 km of trackline were surveyed with 364 cetacean sightings (1,079 individuals). An additional 28 cetacean sightings were made (175 individuals) during off effort periods. Species included harbor porpoise (<i>Phocoena phocoena</i>), Dall’s porpoise (<i>Phocoenoides dalli</i>), Pacific white-sided dolphin (<i>Lagenorhynchus obliquidens</i>), killer whale (<i>Orcinus orca</i>), minke whale (<i>Balaenoptera acutorostrata</i>), fin whale (<i>Balaenoptera physalus</i>), humpback whale (<i>Megaptera novaeangliae</i>), sperm whale (<i>Physeter macrocephalus</i>), Baird’s beaked whale  (<i>Berardius bairdii</i>), and Cuvier’s beaked whale (<i>Ziphius cavirostris</i>).\n\nPurpose:\nThe primary purpose was to conduct a marine mammal survey as a piggyback project to the NOAA/AFSC acoustic pollock survey in the Gulf of Alaska around Kodiak Island and the Kenai Peninsula and use sighting data to estimate the abundance of and to describe the distribution of whales and porpoises in the survey area.",

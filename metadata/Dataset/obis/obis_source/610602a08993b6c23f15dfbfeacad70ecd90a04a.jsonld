    "description": "Original provider:\nHDR Environmental, Operations and Construction, Inc.\n\nDataset credits:\nThe U.S. Navy Marine Species Monitoring Program\n\nAbstract:\nTwo aerial marine species monitoring survey events occurred during 19 through 22 October 2011 and 07 through 16 October 2012 for an Airborne Mine Neutralization System (AMNS) live-inert explosive research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) event. These surveys were conducted off the west coast of Florida in\nthe Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) Study Area in the\nGulf of Mexico (GOM). The AMNS is a mine countermeasures device that includes an\nexplosive charge.\n\nPurpose:\nU.S. Navy protected marine species monitoring during AMNS explosives test event\n\nSupplemental information:\nReferences will be available when they are ready.\nAll the US Navy-funded survey datasets are found in the <a href=\"http://seamap.env.duke.edu/partner/NAVY\">OBIS-SEAMAP US Navy</a> page.",

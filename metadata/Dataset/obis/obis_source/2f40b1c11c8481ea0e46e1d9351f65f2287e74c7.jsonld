    "name": "Pelagic thaliaceans samples from bongo nets near Stradbroke Island, East Australian Current,Tasman Sea (2019-2021)",
    "description": "Thaliaceans were sampled using bongo nets during the austral Spring (11-27 September 2019) and austral Autumn (14 May- 2 June 2021) during the following voyages on RV Investigator IN2019_V05 and IN2021_V03.Some thaliaceans (including pyrosomes and some salps undertake diel vertical migration,and migrating taxa are typically more abundant in shallow waters at night. Zooplankton were sampled using a 100-µmmesh, 0.2-m diameter ring net that was mounted inside the bongo net.\nVoyage details (reports, other data etc.) are at https://www.marine.csiro.au/data/trawler/survey_details.cfm?survey=IN2019_V05 and  https://www.marine.csiro.au/data/trawler/survey_details.cfm?survey=IN2021_V03.

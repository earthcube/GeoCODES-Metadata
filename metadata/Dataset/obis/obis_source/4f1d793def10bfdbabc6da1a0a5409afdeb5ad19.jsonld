    "description": "Original provider:\nFlorida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute\n\nDataset credits:\nNOAA Fisheries, Southeast Regional Office\nFlorida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, Fish and Wildlife Research Institute\nClearwater Marine Aquarium Research Institute\nFunding for surveys provided by: NOAA Fisheries, U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and Georgia Department of Natural Resources\n\nAbstract:\nRight whale Early Warning System (EWS) aerial surveys are conducted during winter in the southeastern United States (SEUS). Surveys in this dataset began in 2016/2017 and were flown by Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) and Clearwater Marine Aquarium Research Institute (CMARI, formerly Sea to Shore Alliance). FWC surveys were conducted in a Cessna 337 Skymaster aircraft with 2 observers (1 of which was also the data recorder); CMARI surveys were typically conducted in a NOAA Twin Otter aircraft with 2 observers plus 1 dedicated data recorder. Target altitude was 1,000 ft, and target speed was 100 kts.\nOnly large whales, large sharks, and leatherback turtles were consistently recorded by both teams. Manatees, ocean sunfish, and manta rays were consistently recorded by FWC. All other species were recorded opportunistically. Surveys broke track to obtain exact locations for large whales; locations for other species typically represent the location along the survey transect.\n\nSupplemental information:\nSurvey data are split into three seasons (2016/17, 2017/18, and 2018/19). This is the 2017/18 season. The 2016/17 season is available at\nhttp://seamap.env.duke.edu/dataset/1990.\nThe 2018/19 season is available at\nhttp://seamap.env.duke.edu/dataset/2004.\n\nEffort data are provided. The Trackline field (used to distinguish effort on a predetermined transect from verification surveys and transits) was recorded by observers during surveys.\n\nAdditional information on species identification and taxonomic resolution may be available in the Notes and Photos fields.",

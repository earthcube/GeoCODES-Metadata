    "description": "Open-ocean environments provide few obvious barriers to the dispersal of marine organisms.\nMajor currents and/or environmental gradients potentially impede gene flow. One\nsystem hypothesized to form an open-ocean dispersal barrier is the Antarctic Polar Front,\nan area characterized by marked temperature change, deep water, and the high-flow Antarctic\nCircumpolar current. Despite these potential isolating factors, several invertebrate\nspecies occur in both regions, including the broadcast-spawning nemertean worm Parborlasia\ncorrugatus. To empirically test for the presence of an open-ocean dispersal barrier, we\nsampled P. corrugatus and other nemerteans from southern South America, Antarctica, and\nthe sub-Antarctic islands. Diversity was assessed by analyzing mitochondrial 16S rRNA\nand cytochrome c oxidase subunit I sequence data with Bayesian inference and TCS haplotype\nnetwork analysis. Appropriate neutrality tests were also employed. Although our\nresults indicate a single well-mixed lineage in Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic, no evidence\nfor recent gene flow was detected between this population and South American P. corrugatus.\nThus, even though P. corrugatus can disperse over large geographical distances, physical\noceanographic barriers (i.e. Antarctic Polar Front and Antarctic Circumpolar Current)\nbetween continents have likely restricted dispersal over evolutionary time. Genetic\ndistances and haplotype network analysis between South American and Antarctic/\nsub-Antarctic P. corrugatus suggest that these two populations are possibly two cryptic species.",

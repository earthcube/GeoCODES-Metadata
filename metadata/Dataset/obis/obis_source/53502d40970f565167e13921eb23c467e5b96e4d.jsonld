    "description": "All sampling was conducted in the Northern Demersal Scalefish Fishery (NDSF) north of Broome off the coast of north western Australia (Fig. 1) in depths of 60â€“110 m across a range of habitats (sand, rubble areas, sponges and soft corals). Samples were collected using commercial fish traps and stereo-BRUV from commercial fishing vessels in June of 2007, 2008 and 2009. Data were collected from 356 trap and 275 stereo-BRUV deployments.",

    "description": "Original provider:\nQld Department of Environment and Heritage Protection\n\nDataset credits:\nData provider\nGHD, Xstrata and  DERM nesting flatback monitoring\nOriginating data center\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/\">Satellite Tracking and Analysis Tool (STAT)</a>\n\n\nAbstract:\nLittle is known of the inter-nesting and feeding habitat used by flatback turtles nesting on the northern part of Cape York Peninsula.  This project is part of a state-wide turtle and dugong awareness program designed to shed light on where the feeding areas are for these turtles.Apudthama Rangers named their turtles ‘Kiku’ and 'Cecilia'.Kiku and Cecilia laid their eggs on Jardine River beach at approximately 7.30pm on 12 September 2014. Upon finishing laying they were intercepted by the Apudthama rangers and taken back to camp for satellite transmitter attachment, assessment and sampling.They were also tagged with both titanium tags and pit tags for future identification and mark recapture analysis. They both appeared to be in good health.Kiku and Cecilia were successfully released and watched from the beach by Rangers as they swam towards the horizon, hopefully to return again soon to nest or shed light on their migration pathways and feeding areas.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=1046\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

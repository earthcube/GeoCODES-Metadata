    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nNOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC)\n\nAbstract:\nAs part of the AMAPPS program, the Southeast Fisheries \nScience Center conducts aerial surveys of continental \nshelf waters along the US east coast from Cape Canaveral, \nFlorida to Cape May, New Jersey. The survey was conducted \nduring 2015 between 23 January and 3 March. It was \nconducted along tracklines oriented perpendicular to the \nshoreline that were latitudinally spaced 20 km apart \naboard a NOAA Twin Otter aircraft at an altitude of 600 \nfeet (183 m) and a speed of 110 knots. The survey was \ndesigned for analysis using Distance sampling and a two-\nteam (independent observer) approach to correct for \nvisibility bias in resulting abundance estimates.\nThe survey covered waters from Cape May, NJ to Cape \nCanaveral, FL including “fine-scale” tracklines in waters \noffshore of New Jersey. The majority of survey effort \noccurred in waters from Cape Hatteras, NC and south. Due \nto weather conditions during the survey, a few areas of \nthe study area were not surveyed.\n\nPurpose:\nThe goal of the survey was to conduct line-transect surveys \nusing the Distance sampling approach to estimate the \nabundance and spatial distribution of marine mammals and \nturtles in waters over the continental shelf (shoreline to \n200m isobaths) from Florida to New Jersey.\n\nSupplemental information:\nPerpendicular distance to the animal is not publicly \navailable.\nThe dataset is accompanied by transect (effort) data \nwhich is provided as a separate file. \nData were further audited in 2018 since publication of \nAnnual Report in 2015.\n\nSightings included were detected on-effort by the forward \nteam only; you may request the full dataset and sightings \nincluding opportunistic ones directly to the provider.\n\nEnvironmental Attribute Codes\nBeaufort Sea state\n0 Calm, mirror like seas\n1 Waves &lt;1ft, rippled surface\n2 Small wavelets (&lt;2 ft), no white caps\n3 Large wavelets (&lt;3ft), scattered white caps\n4 Swell 3-4 ft, numerous white caps\n5 Swell &gt;5 ft, many white caps, some spray\n6 Swell &gt;10 ft, white caps everywhere, spray\nCloudCover\n0 Clear\n1 0-25% Cloudy\n2 26-50% Cloudy\n3 51-75% Cloudy\n4 76-100% Cloudy\n5 Overcast\nGlare\n0 No Glare\n1 &lt;10% of visual field\n2 10-25% of visual field\n3 25-50% of visual field\n4 50-75% of visual field\n5 &gt;75% of visual field\nWeather\n0 Clear\n1 Mist\n2 Light Rain\n3 Heavy Rain\nVisibility\n0 Clear\n1 Good\n2 Fair\n3 Poor\nHaze\n0 No\n1 Yes\nFog\n0 No\n1 Yes\nSun penetration (Sun pen)\n0 Poor\n1 Fair\n2 Good\n3 Excellent\nTurbidity\n0 Poor\n1 Fair\n2 Good\n3 Excellent",

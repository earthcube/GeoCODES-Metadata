    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nNOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center\n\nAbstract:\nIn April 2019, the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center and Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary conducted a collaborative exploratory ship-based survey for humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument (PMNM) aboard the NOAA Oscar Elton Sette. During the 6-day effort the shallow atolls and banks extending from Middle Bank (north of Kauai) to St. Rogatien Banks (north of French Frigate Shoals) were surveyed. There were 60 cetacean sightings, most of which were humpback whales.\n\nSupplemental information:\nData were collected under NMFS permit 20311.\nThe data included here are the sightings and on-effort tracks recorded within WinCruz survey software and extracted from the QA/QC'd DAS file using the R package swfscDAS (https://smwoodman.github.io/swfscDAS).\n\nAttributes for fields within the trackline files:\nCruise - see description in attribute table below\nsegnum - segment number for continuous on-effort line\nDate - Local date m/dd/yyyy\nTimeStart - Local time at start of on-effort segment\nLatStart - Latitude in decimal degrees at starting point of on-effort segment\nLongStart - Longitude in decimal degrees at starting point of on-effort segment\nTimeEnd - Local time at end of on-effort segment\nLatEnd - Latitude in decimal degrees at end point of on-effort segment\nLongEnd - Longitude in decimal degrees at end point of on-effort segment\nMode - see description in attribute table below\nEffType - see description in attribute table below\navgSpdKt - average speed (knots) of the ship over the on-effort segment traveled\navgBft - average Beaufort Sea State over the on-effort segment\n\nOther data not included here:\nPhotos and biopsy samples were collected during some sightings. Acoustic detections were recorded from a towed hydrophone array. Sonobuoys were deployed opportunistically.  \nOceanographic data were collected (CTD).",

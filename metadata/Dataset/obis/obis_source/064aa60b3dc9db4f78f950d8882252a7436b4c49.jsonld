    "description": "This series of surveys represents the first attempt to quantitatively assess dugong distribution and abundance throughout the west Kimberley region. The 1985 survey was divided into two sections - The southern section, which extended from LaGrange Bay to Broome and the northern section, which commenced just north of Broome and extended to Cape Leveque including the Lacepede Islands and into King Sound\nFor all sections two flights were conducted during each of April, July and October resulting in a total of 12 flights. Each flight within each survey area was replicated, with transects flown perpendicular to the coast at a height of 275m and speed of 90 knots. Distances between transects varied as did the lengths of transects as flights were generally made to a point where visibility restricted the sighting potential. Observations were conducted by a single observer with markers delineating a strip on the water surface equivalent to 400m wide. Flights were conducted during neap tides to maximise sighting potential. Aside from dugong observation other megafauna, such as dolphins and turtles, were also recorded, but for the purposes of this report only dugong sightings are described.\nData and report from https://data.pawsey.org.au/public/?path=/WA%20Node%20Ocean%20Data%20Network/AODN/Dave_Holley_Dugongs (December 2020)",

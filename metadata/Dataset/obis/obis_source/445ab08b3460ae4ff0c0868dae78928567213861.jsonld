    "description": "Original provider:\nArturo Serrano\n\nDataset credits:\nArturo Serrano, Laboratorio de Mamiferos Marinos, Universidad Veracruzana\n\nAbstract:\nThe distribution and abundance of marine mammals along the United States coast of the Gulf of Mexico are well-documented, but similar studies for the Mexican coast of the Gulf of Mexico are lacking. Furthermore, these animals are important indicators of the marine ecosystem health, and scientific research is needed to develop appropriate conservation strategies. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the diversity, distribution, and relative abundance of marine mammals in the northern coasts of Veracruz, Mexico.\n\nPurpose:\nThe objective of this study was to determine the diversity, distribution, and relative abundance of aquatic mammals in  Veracruz, Mexico.",

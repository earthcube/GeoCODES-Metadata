    "description": "Original provider:\nVirginia Aquarium &amp; Marine Science Foundation and University of North Carolina Wilmington\n\nDataset credits:\nVirginia Aquarium Foundation - Sarah D. Mallette, Gwen G. Lockhart, Susan G. Barco \nUniversity of North Carolina Wilmington - William A. McLellan, Ryan J. McAlarney Erin W. Cummings and D. Ann Pabst\n\nAbstract:\nThe data provided were collected as part of the Documenting Whale Migration off Virginia's Coast for Use in Marine Spatial Planning project - funded by the Virginia Coastal Zone Management Program Grant Section 306 Environmental Enhancement Program Strategy Project of Special Merit.  \n\nNA14NOS4190141 Jan 2014 - March 2016\n\nAerial surveys were conducted under NOAA Scientific Permits No. 948-1692-00 and 16473, held by UNCW.\n\nPurpose:\nOn November 1, 2013, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) announced Dominion Virginia Power was the provisional winner of the commercial lease area offshore of Virginia (VA WEA). Development of off shore wind energy poses potential threats to marine mammals, including direct effects (i.e.vessel interactions, collision and entanglement with structures, displacement, avoidance, or injury due to noise from construction or operations) and indirect threats (i.e. effects on prey species, increased risk of fishery and vessel interaction through displacement out of the WEA) (BOEM 2012). This information is important to mitigate the potentially harmful impacts from ocean development, shipping, and other anthropogenic activities. To address these existing data gaps, we have collected marine mammal and sea turtle sighting data from aerial surveys conducted off the coast of Virginia from November 2012 to December 2016.\n\nSupplemental information:\nThe sightings are split into the left and right sides. The sightings from the right side are available in http://seamap.env.duke.edu/dataset/1375\n\nOpportunistic sightings (eventcode=10.0) are not included.\n\nEffort data (tracklines) are available upon request and permission from the provider.",

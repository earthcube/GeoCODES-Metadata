    "description": "Population dynamics of Cladocera were studied from 1967 to 1969, as a part of a multidisciplinary program designed to study biological and physical processes pertinent to the marine food web in St. Margaret’s Bay, Nova Scotia. Samples were collected using plankton ring nets with the objective to examine seasonal variation in abundance of important species/taxa of zooplankton. This resource focuses on cladocera collected during preliminary sampling in 1967 and during the multidisciplinary program in 1968 and 1969.",

    "description": "This resource contains species distribution records extracted from the Fisheries and Oceans Canada BioChem database for the BioChem 'BedfordBasin1967_FRB_R120' series of records.  This collection contains diatom and dinoflagellate abundance and depth distribution information obtained as part of a 1967 sampling program in the Bedford Basin.  \n\nSamples were collected using water bottles at 7 discrete depths from the surface to 60m. Lugol preserved samples were analysed and the counts per litre of diatoms and dinoflagellates were recorded.\n\nSample analysis results were archived in the BioChem database.  This OBIS resource contains a subset of these database records - at this time only abundance information has been released.",

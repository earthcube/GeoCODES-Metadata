    "description": "All surveys were carried out by the principal researcher using Rapid Ecological Assessment. The dataset comprises 33 entries from 7 reef locations. Species recorded: octocorals (soft corals, gorgonians, sea fans, sea whips, sea pens, leather corals, arborescent octocorals, blue coral, stoloniferans), black and wire coral. Note that species are mostly at generic level.\nSite locations: Cumberland Passage, Dungeness, Tuesday Islet No. 4, Thursday, Warrior, Wednesday, Zuna.\nTaxa have been matched to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS). This dataset was sourced on July 2018 from the original DiGIR dataset at OBIS and updated to reflect changes in the OBIS data requirements.",

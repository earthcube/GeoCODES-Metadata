    "description": "This is the OBIS extraction of the OTN Bay of Fundy: Spiny Dogfish project, consisting only of the release tagging metadata. i.e. the locations  and dates of tagged animal release. If readers are  interested in the full source  dataset they should refer to the OTN web site  (members.oceantrack.org). Abstract: To determine if mature female dogfish remain in Canadian waters or if they cross over the US/Canadian border to American waters. The results would have an effect on the joint management of the dogfish fishery between Canada and the US and help determine the contribution spawning females have to the NW Atlantic metapopulation of dogfish. The data would help with future management of the fishery as well as future discussions with the US.",

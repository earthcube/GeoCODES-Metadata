    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nNOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center\n\nAbstract:\nGulf of Mexico Sperm Whale Survey was conducted by NOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center in June-July 2000. The survey consisted of several techniques including acoustic recording tag, visual survey, photo-ID, DNA sampling, behavioral observation and fecal sampling. This data set is the result of the visual survey.\n\nIn total, 30 sightings of sperm whale were recorded in a 30 day survey period.\n\nPurpose:\nAs an endangered species, sperm whale is protected under Marine Mammal Protection Act. As such, the biological data on sperm whale is required to produce stock assessment reports.\n\nThis survey was the pilot study to test and refine a wide range of sperm whale research techniques in Gulf of Mexico. The survey will contribute to answering the following research questions.\n\n1. What are the effects of anthropogenic noise on the distribution, behavior and vocalization patterns of sperm whales?\n\n2. What is the stock status of sperm whales that inhabit the Gulf of Mexico compared to the adjacent Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea?\n\n3. Will surveys using both acoustic array methods and visual surveys improve the NMFS's abundance estimates of sperm whales in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico?\n\n4. Is the group composition and social structure of sperm whales in the Gulf of Mexico similar or different compared to sperm whales in other parts of the world?\n\n5. How do sperm whales spatially use the Gulf of Mexico? Are there specific feeding, breeding, socializing and resting areas?\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2020-09-30] The following invalid species names were corrected according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS).\nBridled Tern: Sterna anaethetus (176897) =&gt; Onychoprion anaethetus (824104)\nCaspian Tern: Sterna caspia (176924) =&gt; Hydroprogne caspia (176935)\nLaughing Gull: Larus atricilla (176837) =&gt; Leucophaeus atricilla (824079)\nRoyal Tern: Sterna maxima (176922) =&gt; Thalasseus maximus (824142)\nSooty Tern: Sterna fuscata (176894) =&gt; Onychoprion fuscatus (824105)",

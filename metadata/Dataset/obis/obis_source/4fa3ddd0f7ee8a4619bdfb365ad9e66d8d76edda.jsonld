    "description": "This animal tracking dataset is derived from Spanoghe et al. (2022, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6580939\">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6580939</a>) a deposit of Movebank study <a href=\"https://www.movebank.org/cms/webapp?gwt_fragment=page=studies,path=study1841091905\">1841091905</a>. Data have been standardized to Darwin Core using the <a href=\"https://inbo.github.io/movepub/\">movepub</a> R package and are downsampled to the first GPS position per hour. The original dataset description follows.\n<em>CURLEW_VLAANDEREN - Eurasian curlews (Numenius arquata, Scolopacidae) breeding in Flanders (Belgium)</em> is a bird tracking dataset published by the <a href=\"https://inbo.be/\">Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO)</a>. It contains animal tracking data collected by the LifeWatch GPS tracking network for large birds (<a href=\"http://lifewatch.be/en/gps-tracking-network-large-birds\">http://lifewatch.be/en/gps-tracking-network-large-birds</a>) for the project/study <strong>CURLEW_VLAANDEREN</strong>, using trackers developed by Ornitela (<a href=\"https://www.ornitela.com\">https://www.ornitela.com</a>). The study has been operational since 2020. In total 5 individuals of Eurasian curlew (<em>Numenius arquata</em>) have been tagged at several locations in Flanders (Belgium), mainly to study their habitat use and migration behaviour. Data are automatically synced with Movebank and from there periodically archived on Zenodo (see <a href=\"https://github.com/inbo/bird-tracking\">https://github.com/inbo/bird-tracking</a>).\nThis dataset was collected using infrastructure provided by INBO and funded by Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO) as part of the Belgian contribution to LifeWatch. Additional funding was provided by Provincie Vlaams-Brabant. Data were collected in collaboration with Natuurpunt Studie.",

    "description": "The aim is to provide a general view of the echinoderm collection of the Paris Museum, which is primarily a scientific collection. The naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, one of the founders of the Theory of Evolution, was the first to really establish the collection of echinoderms at the Paris Museum. There are both dry and alcohol-preserved lots. Some sea cucumber specimens are preserved as microscopic preparations on slides. The number of lots is estimated at 500,000, of which 0.4% are types. Echinoderms have been collected in all oceans, at all latitudes. The largest numbers of specimens were collected relatively recently in the Indo-West Pacific.",

    "description": "Original provider:\nAldemaro Romero, Macalester College\n\nDataset credits:\nAldemaro Romero, Macalester College\n\nAbstract:\nTo document the Grenadian marine mammal fauna and its distribution in the eastern Caribbean, we conducted field and archival studies in that country. All records of sirenians and cetaceans for Grenada were assembled and analyzed. The total number of confirmed marine mammal species for this part of the world is 11. The humpback whale (<i>Megaptera novaeangliae</i>) was the most commonly reported mysticete species while a variety of odontocetes seem to be equally frequent in those waters. The manatee (<i>Trichechus manatus</i>) has been extinct from those waters for at least 300 years. Comparison with the marine mammal fauna of adjacent regions (Venezuela, Trinidad, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines), leads us to believe that at least seven additional species of cetaceans may be present in Grenadian waters, probably as occasional visitors.\n\nPurpose:\nThere are three indications that the marine mammal fauna of Grenada may be much more abundant and diverse than ever reported. Therefore, we decided to investigate the nature of the marine mammal fauna for that country. To that end, we combined information for three major sources: data from published or unpublished (archival) documents, accounts from reliable observers, and our own field observations. As a result, we have been able to increase the number of confirmed records from three to 11.\n\nSupplemental information:\nSightings from the field observations are a subset of the entire dataset, presented here on OBIS-SEAMAP.\nFor records that did not have time of observation available, \"00:00:00\" was used and noted in the [Notes] field.\nFor records that originally sighted a range for the number of individuals observed, the median number was used to be conservative, and noted in the [Notes] field.",

    "description": "This is the OBIS extraction of the OTN/DFO: Porbeagle and Blue Sharks project, consisting only of the release tagging metadata. i.e. the locations  and dates of tagged animal release. If readers are  interested in the full source  dataset they should refer to the OTN web site  (members.oceantrack.org). Abstract: To determine movements of porbeagle and blue sharks in Canadian waters and to see if they cross over the US/Canadian border to American waters.

    "description": "Mesozooplankton community composition and structure were examined throughout the Dâ€™Entrecasteaux Channel, Huon Estuary and North West Bay, Tasmania, from November 2004 to October 2005.\nThe composition of the mesozooplankton community was typical of inshore, temperate marine habitats, with seasonally higher abundance in summer and autumn and lower numbers in winter and spring. Copepods were the largest contributors to total abundance across all seasons and stations, while cladocerans and appendicularians were proportionally abundant in spring and summer. The faecal pellets of these three main groups, along with those of krill and amphipods, also contributed significantly to material recovered from sediment traps. Meroplanktonic larvae of benthic animals showed short-term peaks in abundance and were often absent from the water column for long periods. Spatially, North West Bay and the Channel had a higher representation of typically marine species, including Calanus australis and Labidocera cervi, while truly estuarine species, such as the copepod Gladioferens pectinatus, were more important in the Huon Estuary.\nData sourced from the IMAS Metadata catalogue https://metadata.imas.utas.edu.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/metadata.show?uuid=b89e4a97-4ce5-455a-ae3a-a88415b50541 on 2021-02-03",

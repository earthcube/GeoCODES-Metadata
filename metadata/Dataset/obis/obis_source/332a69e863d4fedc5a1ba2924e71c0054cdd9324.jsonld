    "name": "PANGAEA - Data from profiles across Mediterranean sedimentary systems (PROMESS)",
    "description": "PROMESS 1 is the first attempt to realise scientific drilling on continental shelves and slopes in the Mediterranean Sea. It is designed for sampling long sections (50-300 m) and realise in situ measurements of shelf and upper slope sedimentary sequences deposited during the last 500 kyr, at 50-300 m water depth. It will provide clues on sea-level changes, slope stability, canyon history and climate variability in physiographic settings with high sedimentation (glacial and interglacial prodeltas) and exceptional preservation of depositional sequences.\n\nThrough PANGAEA, absolute and relative abundance data on planktic and benthic foraminifera in hole PRAD1-2 have been made publicly available.",

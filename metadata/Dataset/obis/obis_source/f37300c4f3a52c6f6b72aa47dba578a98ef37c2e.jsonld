    "description": "This study investigates the faunal biodiversity of the deep water sediments of Grand Manan Basin in the Bay Fundy on the East Coast of North America. Specimens were collected using a 0.1 m2 grab, and identified and enumerated at the Atlantic Reference Centre. The sediment types at the research sites were found to be complex containing cobbles, pebbles, sand and clay. The specimens retrieved from these samples showed a great degree of biodiversity, and include species not previously reported in this region.\n\nVersion 1 of this resource was created as a Census of Marine Life dataset in 2005.",

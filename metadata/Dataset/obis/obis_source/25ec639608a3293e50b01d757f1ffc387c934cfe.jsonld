    "description": "Seabird and incidental cetacean and seal sightings were recorded during daylight hours from a transit from Sydney to Broome, Oct 2017. Observations were made every ten minutes in the forward quadrant. There were 410 observations from 20 species of birds and 1 cetaceans. Each species has been linked where possible to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS https://www.marinespecies.org).\nFurher details at http://www.marlin.csiro.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/search#!c2d03fae-9b49-4bb1-b364-f1651678c166.

    "description": "Original provider:\nDuke University Marine Laboratory\n\nDataset credits:\nDuke University Marine Laboratory\n\nAbstract:\nThis project was part of a monitoring program designed to provide quantitative information on the seasonal occurrence, distribution and density of marine mammals in the coastal waters around the Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune.  The work consisted of three components: \n(1) coastal line transect surveys, designed to provide estimates of the density of marine mammals and sea turtles in near-shore ocean waters â€“this dataset; \n(2) small boat-based photo-identification surveys to document patterns of residency by individual dolphins; and\n(3) passive acoustic monitoring of the occurrence and distribution of bottlenose dolphins in the New River and coastal waters.  \n\nWe conducted eleven shipboard surveys in the near-shore coastal waters of Onslow Bay from August 2010 to November 2011. We conducted photographic surveys for bottlenose dolphins in the New River on 19 days between October 2010 and November 2011. We recorded 54 sightings throughout the Intracoastal Waterway and New River, with some groups seen as far upriver as Morgan Bay. We conducted seven shipboard surveys in the near-shore coastal waters of Onslow Bay from October 2012 to September 2013.\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2014-04-10] 2012-13 data were appended. The following attributes were added since 2012.\nCueTime, CueLat, CueLon, Calves, Obs\n\n[2013-05-13] Additional survey data for the DUML Camp Lejeune monitoring program 2010-2011 are available on OBIS-SEAMAP in the <a href=\"http://seamap.env.duke.edu/datasets/detail/959\">\"DUML New River surveys on the occurrence, distribution and density of marine mammals in Camp Lejeune 2010-2011\"</a> dataset.\nAll the US Navy-funded survey datasets are found in the <a href=\"http://seamap.env.duke.edu/partner/NAVY\">OBIS-SEAMAP US Navy</a> page.",

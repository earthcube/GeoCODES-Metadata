    "description": "As part of the sediment water interface program of the Atlantic Oceanographic Group a study of the distribution and ecology of benthic organisms was initiated in 1961 and in February of 1962 van Veen grab samples were collected during the CHS Baffin cruise (Peer 1963).\n\nSpecies distribution information associated with this study were digitized, standardized and republished as part of the Atlantic Coastal Zone Information Steering Committee (ACZISC) Atlantic Ecosystem Initiative (AEI) funded project “Atlantic Canada’s Biological Data for Ecosystem Planning and Decision-making” and OBIS Canada.",

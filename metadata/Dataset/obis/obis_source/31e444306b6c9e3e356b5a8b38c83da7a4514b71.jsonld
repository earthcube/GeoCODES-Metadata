    "description": "Octocoral biodiversity was surveyed at eighteen sites across all three Rowley Shoals (Mermaid, Clerke and Imperieuse Reefs). At each site, transects commenced at ~20m depth and ascended gradually, finishing at ~5m depth over a horizontal distance of ~300m. All octocorals encountered were identified (so far as possible in the field), most were photographed and selected samples were taken of new observations for later taxonomic analysis.\nTaxa have been matched to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS). This dataset was sourced on July 2018 from the original DiGIR dataset at OBIS and updated to reflect changes in the OBIS data requirements.",

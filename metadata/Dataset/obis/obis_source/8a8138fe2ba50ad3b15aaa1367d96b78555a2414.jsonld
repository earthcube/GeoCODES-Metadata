    "description": "Seabird and incidental cetacean and seal sightings were recorded during daylight hours during the transit from Hobart to Sydney, May 2016. This voyage was used as a trial of acquiring observations from the RV Investigator observation deck and testing the data recording system. Observations were made every ten minutes in the forward quadrant. There were 393 observations from 33 species of birds, 3 cetaceans and one seal. The commonest bird species were Pachyptila turtur, Thalassarche cauta, Sterna bergii and Morus serrator. Each species has been linked where possible to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS https://www.marinespecies.org).\nVoyage details (metadata, projects, other datasets either online or as downloads, publications and reports, events, maps etc) can be accessed at https://www.marine.csiro.au/data/trawler/survey_details.cfm?survey=IN2016_T02\nIf this data has been used in any products, please acknowledge with the following: We acknowledge the use of the CSIRO Marine National Facility (https://ror.org/01mae9353) in undertaking this research.\n",

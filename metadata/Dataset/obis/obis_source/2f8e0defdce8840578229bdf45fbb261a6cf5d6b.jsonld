    "description": "The present study was conducted in the continental shelf of Heraklion Bay in depths from 50 to 200 meters, covering an area exposed to wave action. The coastal zone is affected by small-scale freshwater inputs and urban waste discharges while the offshore system is characterised by marked oligotrophy. The study area is located outside the local bottom trawling fishing grounds.",

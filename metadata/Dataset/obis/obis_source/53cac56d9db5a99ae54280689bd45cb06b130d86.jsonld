    "name": "Stereo BRUVS survey of the Money Shoal and Pillar Bank, Arafura Marine Park, Australia (2020)",
    "description": "Observations of demersal fish communities on and around Money Shoal and Pillar Bank, Arafura Marine Park were undertaken using baited remote underwater video (stereo-BRUV) units. Each stereo-BRUVS comprises a pair of high-definition video cameras (GoPro Hero5) set to record at 1080p resolution at a rate of 30 frames per second. Each stereo-BRUV was baited with approximately 1 kg of crushed pilchards (Sardinops spp.) held within a plastic-coated wire mesh basket, attached to a stainless steel bait arm and positioned 1.5 m in front of the cameras. Each system was deployed for 60 minutes on the seafloor. Neighbouring deployments were separated by at least 400 m to reduce the likelihood of fish swimming between neighbouring stereo-BRUV deployments.\nData from GlobalArchive (https://globalarchive.org/) project 293 and accessed on 2021-03-16. Report of the Arafura Marine Park survey (SOL 7491 / GA 0366) is at https://www.nespmarine.edu.au/document/arafura-marine-park-post-survey-report, covering multibeam, sediment samples and video observations from towed video.",

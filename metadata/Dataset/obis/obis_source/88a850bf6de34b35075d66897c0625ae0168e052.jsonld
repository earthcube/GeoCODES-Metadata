    "description": "Original provider:\nErik Olsen, Institute of Marine Research\n\nDataset credits:\nErik Olsen and Leif NÃ¸ttestad, Institute of Marine Research\n\nAbstract:\nLong-distance migration for most species of baleen whales is poorly understood because of the practical difficulties and substantial expense involved in gathering relevant data. Presently, satellite tracking is the only method that delivers the necessary detail and quantitative data on movement patterns on far-ranging marine mammals. In this study, ARGOS satellite tags were deployed on North Atlantic sei whales (<i>Balaenoptera borealis</i>) at the Azores Islands. Data from one whale showed a cumulative 4,102 km movement from tagging at Faial Island in the Azores on 12 April 2005 via the Charlie Gibbs Fracture Zone (CGFZ) to the Labrador Sea where transmissions stopped\non 7 June 2005. For a portion of the distance from CGFZ to the Labrador Sea, the whale moved in the prevailing direction of the surface current pattern.\nErratic movement in five areas along the\nmovement track indicates feeding behavior, particularly in the CGFZ. The results show the largescale movement potential of North Atlantic sei whales from wintering grounds to highly productive potential feeding areas in the Labrador Sea.\n\nPurpose:\nThe purpose of this study was to track sei whales from winter grounds off the Azores to summer feeding grounds in the North Atlantic\n\nSupplemental information:\nAll location classes are visualized.\n There is a gap from location of tagging to first transmission.",

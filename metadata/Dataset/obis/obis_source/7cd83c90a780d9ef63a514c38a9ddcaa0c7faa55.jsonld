    "description": "This animal tracking dataset is derived from Oosterbeek et al. (2022, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6656937\">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6656937</a>) a deposit of Movebank study <a href=\"https://www.movebank.org/cms/webapp?gwt_fragment=page=studies,path=study1605803389\">1605803389</a>. Data have been standardized to Darwin Core using the <a href=\"https://inbo.github.io/movepub/\">movepub</a> R package and are downsampled to the first GPS position per hour. The original dataset description follows.\n<em>O_AMELAND - Eurasian oystercatchers (Haematopus ostralegus, Haematopodidae) breeding on Ameland (the Netherlands)</em> is a bird tracking dataset published by <a href=\"http://www.sovon.nl\">Sovon</a>, the <a href=\"https://ibed.uva.nl\">University of Amsterdam</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.inbo.be/en\">Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO)</a>. It contains animal tracking data for the study <strong>O_AMELAND</strong> using trackers developed by the University of Amsterdam Bird Tracking System (UvA-BiTS, <a href=\"http://www.uva-bits.nl\">http://www.uva-bits.nl</a>). The study was&nbsp;operational from 2010 to 2013. In total 15 individuals of Eurasian oystercatchers (<em>Haematopus ostralegus</em>) have been tagged as a breeding bird on the Wadden island Ameland (the Netherlands), mainly to study their space use during the breeding season. Data are uploaded from the UvA-BiTS database to Movebank and from there archived on Zenodo (see <a href=\"https://github.com/inbo/bird-tracking\">https://github.com/inbo/bird-tracking</a>). No new data are expected.\nThese data were collected by Sovon and University of Amsterdam (UvA). Funding was provided by NAM and supported by the UvA-BiTS virtual lab on the Dutch national e-infrastructure, built with support of LifeWatch, the Netherlands eScience Center, SURFsara and SURFfoundation. The dataset was published with funding from Stichting NLBIF - Netherlands Biodiversity Information Facility.",

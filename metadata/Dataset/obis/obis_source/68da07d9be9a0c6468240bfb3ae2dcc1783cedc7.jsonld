    "description": "The Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory (MAGNT) Coelenterate Collection, established in 1981, consists of about 17,000 databased specimens. The majority of the specimens have been collected from locations in Northern Australia. The collection includes 108 holotypes and 242 paratypes. The collection mainly focuses on shallow water tropical species from the Indo-Pacific, but also includes deep water material from Southern Australia. The collection also includes a small amount of comparative material from the rest of the world.\n\nSpecimens can be lent to workers at other institutions upon application and the MAGNT also welcomes visiting researchers.\n\nThe collection was established in 1981 and continues to the present.",

    "description": "The water mass designated as the Southern or Antarctic Ocean is among the most productive areas of the world. In spite of the recent emphasis on biological oceanographic research, the species composition and distribution of the primary producers, mostly diatoms, has not been thoroughly examined in many areas. Knowledge of the organisms involved in primary production is of special interest as man considers use of marine resources to meet the needs of expanding world population. Phytoplankton diatoms in the Antarctic are the major food source for the tremendous krill (Euphausiacea) populations, which in turn are the food source for many of the large whale, seal, fish, and bird populations in this area. It is necessary to understand the species composition and ecology of the Antarctic primary producers and their relationship to the consumer levels in the food web before adequate use of the abundant marine resources of the Antarctic Ocean can proceed. This work is concerned with the most basic problem involved, the species composition of the phytoplankton diatoms and their distribution.\n",

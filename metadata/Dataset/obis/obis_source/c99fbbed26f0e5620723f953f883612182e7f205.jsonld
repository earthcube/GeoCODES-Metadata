    "description": "Original provider:\nDuke University Marine Laboratory\n\nDataset credits:\nDuke University Marine Laboratory\n\nAbstract:\nThe site off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina is subsumed within the U.S. Navy’s Atlantic Fleet Training and Testing (AFTT) Monitoring Program. The survey area encompasses approximately 16,000 km² and includes continental shelf waters and deeper waters beyond the shelf break. The area also includes a large portion of the Cape Hatteras Special Research Area (CHSRA), designated by NOAA Fisheries to address interactions between short-finned pilot whales (<i>Globicephala macrorhynchus</i>) and the pelagic longline fisheries. A monitoring program (shipboard and aerial surveys) was implemented in 2011 to estimate density and document distribution and seasonal residency of marine mammals and sea turtles in the CHSRA.\n\nPurpose:\nThe primary objectives of these surveys are to:\n(1) document species occurrence and examine patterns of residency of marine mammals and turtles in the defined study area\n(2) determine relatedness among individuals, populations and species within the study area\n(3) supplement the visual surveys with acoustic monitoring using a High-frequency Acoustic Recording Package (HARP)\n(4) collect baseline data on the diving behavior of deep diving cetaceans e.g. short-finned pilot whales and beaked whales\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2016-04-14] Sightings in 2015 were appended. The following columns were added (these columns are blank for the sightings before 2015):\nend_time, end_lat, end_long, behav_state, totminest, totmaxest, mincalves, maxcalves, minyoy, maxyoy, totposid, totnoid, totfinbest, calfposid, calfnoid, calfinbest, yoyposid, comments, photo_notes, sighting_notes, observations, photo_grades, acoustics\nof which totposid, totnoid, totfinbest, calfposid, calfnoid, calfinbest, yoyposid, comments, sighting_notes, observations, photo_grades are blank for the 2015 sightings.\n\n[2015-05-13] The 2013-2014 data were appended.\n[2014-03-21] The 2013 data were appended.\nAll the US Navy-funded survey datasets are found in the <a href=\"http://seamap.env.duke.edu/partner/NAVY\">OBIS-SEAMAP US Navy</a> page.",

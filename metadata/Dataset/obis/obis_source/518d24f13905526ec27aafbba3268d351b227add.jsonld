    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nNOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC)\n\nAbstract:\nDuring 7-26 August 2011, the Northeast Fisheries Science Center(NEFSC)conducted an aerial abundance survey targeting marine mammals and sea turtles. The NEFSCâ€™s survey covered waters from Long Island, New York, USA to the southern tip of Nova Scotia, Canada, and from the coastline to about the\n100 m depth contour. This aerial survey was a component of the AMAPPS project. The airplane flew at 600 feet above the water surface at about 110 knots. The two independent team data collection methods were used. Within the study area of 199,656 km2, there were about 6,481 km of on-effort track lines, of which 5,979 km were conducted in sea state conditions less than Beaufort 4.On these track lines, there were 10 species of identifiable cetaceans,and 3 sea turtle species detected.\n\nPurpose:\nThe objectives of the NEFSC aerial survey were 1) to estimate abundance of cetaceans and turtles in waters north of New Jersey and shallower than 100 m depth and 2) to investigate how the animals' distribution and abundance relate to their physical and biological ecosystem.\n\nSupplemental information:\nPerpendicular distance to the animal is not publicly available.",

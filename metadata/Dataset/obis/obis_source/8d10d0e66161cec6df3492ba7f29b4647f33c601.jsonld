    "description": "Original provider:\nDalhousie University\n\nDataset credits:\nHal Whitehead, Department of Biology, Dalhousie University\n\nAbstract:\nThe Sargasso Sea cruise surveyed marine birds and mammals in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean, during the summer of 2004. This survey onboard the Valiant 40 ocean-going research vessel Balaena, consisted of two survey legs: a sail from Halifax, Nova Scotia to Beaufort, North Carolina (May 5 - 27), and a round trip from Beaufort, North Carolina to offshore waters north of the Bahamas (June 2 - 22). Seabirds were surveyed during the second leg of this cruise by Lesley Thorne, a graduate student from the Duke University Marine Laboratory.\n\nPurpose:\nThe seabird survey data summarize the distribution and abundance of marine birds during the Sargasso Sea cruise.\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2020-09-30] The following invalid species names were corrected according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS).\nBonaparte's Gull: Larus philadelphia (176839) =&gt; Chroicocephalus philadelphia (824040)\nLaughing Gull: Larus atricilla (176837) =&gt; Leucophaeus atricilla (824079)\n\nThis dataset includes survey effort and sightings on effort and during focal follows of sperm whale schools (off effort). The survey track was recorded by logging a position every 10 minutes using the vessel's GPS.",

    "description": "In May-June 2007, an \"autumn bloom cruise\" was conducted on the National Marine Facility, Southern Surveyor, led by Peter Thompson. The voyage was conducted in three legs, with a the first conducted from May 10th to May 15th focused on benthic habitats. Benthic based operations were performed over two transects near Perth at 31.71ºS and 31.76ºS from 115.63ºE to 115.15ºE with stations at depths of 30, 40, 50, 75, 100 and 150m. Acoustic swath mapping of the sea-bed was conducted during the entire voyage; at each of the 12 study sites, benthic sled dredges, sediment grabs, benthic video and CTD casts were completed.",

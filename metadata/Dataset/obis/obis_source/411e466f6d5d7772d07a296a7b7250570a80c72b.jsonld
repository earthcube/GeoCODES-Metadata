    "description": "Biological data collected on Southern Surveyor cruise SS 01/2000. This voyage took place off around the south-east coast of Australia including Victorian, Tasmanian and South Australian waters, in the areas of the south eastern \"large marine domain\" and the Great Australian Bight Marine Park, during April - May 2000, under the leadership of Rudy Kloser (legs 1 and 3) and Alan Williams (leg 2). Biological data collected on this cruise include fish trawls, benthic sled and video camera data, largely in association with ground truthing for swath mapping carried out on the same voyage. In addition, on leg 2, benthic invertebrates and demersal fishes were collected from the lower continental slope region (approx. depths between 1500 and 2000m) to enable the extension of biophysical regionalisations to a new depth, and on leg 3, collections were made to form a taxonomic inventory of demersal fishes and benthic invertebrates from the Great Australian Bight Marine Protected Area, in areas with contrasting histories of light vs. heavy trawling activity.\nReports, metadata and other data from this voyage are at https://www.marine.csiro.au/data/trawler/survey_details,cfm?survey=SS200001\n",

    "description": "In the first benthic biological survey of the Arafura Sea, a 2-person team collected 107 samples from 56 stations on Southern Surveyor voyage 05 of May 2005. This program was conducted opportunistically in conjunction with a Geoscience Australia geological survey of selected regions in the Arafura Sea. This survey only covers approximately 5% of the total Arafura Sea, but it provides a valuable shallow to deep transect across the region in depths ranging from 69 to 234 metres. At least 245 macroscopic species, including a diverse variety of invertebrates (e.g., sponges, corals, sea anemones, tunicates, worms, crustaceans, brittle stars, feather stars) and 6 small fish species, were\nphotographed and documented with preliminary identifications.\nFurther details of the voyage are at https://www.marine.csiro.au/data/trawler/survey_details.cfm?survey=SS200505. The eight biological data reports can be downloaded at https://www.marine.csiro.au/data/trawler/download.cfm?file_id=5458",

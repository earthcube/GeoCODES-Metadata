    "description": "Original provider:\nVirginia Aquarium Stranding Response Program\n\nDataset credits:\nVirginia Aquarium Stranding Response Program\n\nAbstract:\nVirginia receives 100-140 marine mammal strandings per year and the Virginia Aquarium &amp; Marine Science Center (VAQS) is the sole response and rehabilitation facility in the state. VAQS records basic (level A) data, for all marine mammals, as well as more in depth (level B and C) data whenever possible. The OBIS dataset contains the basic level A data for all stranded marine mammals, responded to by VAQS, and spans the years of 1988-2008.\n\nPurpose:\nThese data can be used to report the presence and seasonality of marine mammal species when survey data are lacking. Absence of a species from the dataset does not, however, indicate absence from the area as stranding data are opportunistic data that require detection of a mortality on a coastline. Those data points located in a water body indicate that the animal was first seen floating. Human interaction (HI) data are included as part of the level A dataset but must be analyzed carefully as 'YES' for HI does not necessarily indicate that the stranding or the death of an animal was caused by human activity.",

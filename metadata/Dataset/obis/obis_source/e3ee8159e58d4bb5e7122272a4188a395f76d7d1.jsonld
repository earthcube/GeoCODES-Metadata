    "description": "Original provider:\nAssociació Cetàcea\n\nAbstract:\nWe currently are conducting a research project on cetaceans. The study is foccussed on the fin whale in the Mediterranean Sea, but we also see other cetaceans such as striped dolphin or bottlenose dolphin. One of the goals of our organization is to contribute to the conservation of the marine life.\n\nPurpose:\nThe Mediterranean fin whale population is rather small and its distribution uncertain for the most part of the year. The main goal of the project is to collect geographical, environmental, biological, behavioral and population data of every sighting. We also want to take photographs of every whale detected.\n\nSupplemental information:\nThe sightings have been made during the Fin Whale Project, a study approved by the Biodiversity and Protection of Animals division of the Departament of Agriculture, Livestock, Fishing, Food and the Environment of the Catalan Government. With this project we expect to improve our knowledge about the fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) in the Mediterranean Sea.",

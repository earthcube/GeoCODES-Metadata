    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nNOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center\n\nAbstract:\nThe 2018 Mariana Archipelago Cetacean Survey (MACS) was a shipboard line transect survey aboard the Oscar Elton Sette that operated in the island waters from Guam to Pagan and west out to the West Mariana Ridge (9 July - 1 August). During 22 days of surveys there were 66 cetacean sightings including 12 identified species.\n\nSupplemental information:\nData were collected under NMFS permit 20311.\nThe data included here are the sightings and on-effort tracks recorded within WinCruz survey software and extracted from the QA/QC'd DAS file using the R package swfscDAS (https://smwoodman.github.io/swfscDAS).\n\nAttributes for fields within the trackline files:\nCruise - see description in attribute table below\nsegnum - segment number for continuous on-effort line\nDate - Local date m/dd/yyyy\nTimeStart - Local time at start of on-effort segment\nLatStart - Latitude in decimal degrees at starting point of on-effort segment\nLongStart - Longitude in decimal degrees at starting point of on-effort segment\nTimeEnd - Local time at end of on-effort segment\nLatEnd - Latitude in decimal degrees at end point of on-effort segment\nLongEnd - Longitude in decimal degrees at end point of on-effort segment\nMode - see description in attribute table below\nEffType - see description in attribute table below\navgSpdKt - average speed (knots) of the ship over the on-effort segment traveled\navgBft - average Beaufort Sea State over the on-effort segment\n\nOther data not included here:\nPhotos and biopsy samples were collected during some sightings. Acoustic detections were recorded from a towed hydrophone array. Sonobuoys were deployed opportunistically. \nHigh-frequency Acoustic Recording Packages (HARP) were recovered and redeployed off Saipan, Tinian, and Pagan. Drifting Acoustic Spar Buoy Recorders (DASBRs) were deployed and recovered opportunistically (McCullough et al. 2021). Oceanographic data were collected (CTD).",

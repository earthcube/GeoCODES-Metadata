    "description": "Data on marine zoobenthic invertebrates were obtained from samples collected from 1967 to 1973 by grab, dredge and trawl samplers in depths for water of 25 to 90 m in an area of 1.2 km2 located in upper Frobisher Bay, southern Baffin Island. Survey results consist of density (number of individuals per square metre) and biomass of species (grams per square metre) for the grab samples, presence only for the trawl samples, and biomass for the dredge samples.\n\nThis research was part of a multidiscipline program developed by the Biological Oceanography Section of the Arctic Biological Station, Department of Fisheries and Oceans to determine the nature and magnitude of the role of benthic invertebrates in an arctic marine ecosystem.",

    "description": "Abundance and biomass of fish species collected during the day from February to August 1979 off the coast of the southeastern United States (Cape Fear, NC to Cape Canaveral, FL). The trawl consists of specifically designed nets attached to a V-shaped, rigid diving vane, which maintains the trawl at depth for extended periods of time at towing speeds up to 5 knots. The IKMT has a 1.8 m x 1.8 m mouth opening, with a 1.050 mm mesh cod end.",

    "description": "Deep-sea fish diversity using environmental DNA metabarcoding of pumped deep-sea water is monitored. Water samples were derived from the intakes located at 400m depth off Yaizu, Suruga Bay and 811m depth off Akazawa, Sagami Bay in Japan. Identical reads obtained by next generation sequencing were referred to the MitoFish (http://mitofish.aori.u-tokyo.ac.jp/), and more than 3% of the total reads were listed.",

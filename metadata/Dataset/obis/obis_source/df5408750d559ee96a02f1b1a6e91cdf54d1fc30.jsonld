    "description": "This inventory of the fishes of Everglades National Park summarizes the ichthyological and fisheries investigations that have provided information on the composition and distribution of the park's marine, brackish and freshwaterfish faunas. Descriptions of the major aquatic habitats of the park provide a context for the subsequent complete inventoy for the area. South Florida is a region in which members of the Antillean and Carolinian fish faunas meet and mix, giving rise to a diverse assemblage of fishes. Two hundred and ninety species offishes have been recorded from the park, the majority of which occur both in North American and tropical West Atlantic waters. All of the native freshwaterfishes in the park are derived from temperate North America; conversely, the seven established non-indigenous fish species originated in tropical waters. The table of species inellides abundance and habitat use irlfortnation. Species that are of hypothetical or questionable occurrence are also noted.",

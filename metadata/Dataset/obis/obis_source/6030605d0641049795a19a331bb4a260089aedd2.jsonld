    "description": "This is the OBIS version of the Atlantic Reference Centre museum database for Canadian Atlantic marine organisms. Specimens represent invertebrates from sponges to tunicates, and fishes. The ichthyoplankton collection is the most extensive, with complete holdings from many scientific broad-scale surveys. Geographic coverage is the Arctic to Cape Cod and the coast to the slope water. Temporally, most specimens were collected from the 1960s to the present.",

    "description": "In May 2018 a 268 cm-long marine sediment core (gravity core ‘GC02’) was collected during RV Investigator voyage IN2018_T02 at a\nwater depth of 104 m close to the continental shelf edge, east of Maria Island (42.845◦S; 148.240◦E) for the purpose of analysis of coccolith assemblages using light and scanning electron microscopy in combination with sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA) techniques. \nVoyage details (metadata, projects, other datasets either online or as downloads, publications and reports, events, maps etc) can be accessed at https://www.marine.csiro.au/data/trawler/survey_details.cfm?survey=IN2018_T02\nIf this data has been used in any products, please acknowledge with the following: We acknowledge the use of the CSIRO Marine National Facility (https://ror.org/01mae9353) in undertaking this research.\n",

    "description": "Original provider:\nHDR Environmental, Operations and Construction, Inc.\n\nDataset credits:\nThe U.S. Navy Marine Species Monitoring Program\n\nAbstract:\nData in this dataset represent animal sightings that occurred during shore-based surveys for marine mammals and sea turtles in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Shore-based surveys were conducted NAVFAC biologists from November 2013 to December 2014, and in September and November of 2015 at nine shore stations around Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The source geodatabase was compiled by HDR under NAVFAC contract N62470-15-D-8006, task order KB11.\n\nSupplemental information:\nSighting locations reflect the animal locations not the locations of the shore stations.\nLocations of the shore stations are available as a static layer.\nRelevant boat-based survey data is available at http://seamap.env.duke.edu/dataset/1954",

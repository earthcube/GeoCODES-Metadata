    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nNOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center\n\nAbstract:\nThe Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center conducted cetacean surveys aboard the NOAA Oscar Elton Sette during the ship's transit from Hawaii to Guam (20 January - 6 February 2010) and covered 2,380 km of on-effort trackline. There were 24 cetacean sightings, most of which were not identified to species. Eight of the cetacean groups were identified to six species. Time and weather limitations prevented the shipâ€™s approach of more of the sighted cetacean groups.\n\nSupplemental information:\nData were collected under NMFS permit 14097.\nThe data included here are the sightings and on-effort tracks recorded within WinCruz survey software and extracted from the QA/QC'd DAS file using the R package swfscDAS (https://smwoodman.github.io/swfscDAS).\n\nAttributes for fields within the trackline files:\nCruise - see description in attribute table below\nsegnum - segment number for continuous on-effort line\nDate - Local date m/dd/yyyy\nTimeStart - Local time at start of on-effort segment\nLatStart - Latitude in decimal degrees at starting point of on-effort segment\nLongStart - Longitude in decimal degrees at starting point of on-effort segment\nTimeEnd - Local time at end of on-effort segment\nLatEnd - Latitude in decimal degrees at end point of on-effort segment\nLongEnd - Longitude in decimal degrees at end point of on-effort segment\nMode - see description in attribute table below\nEffType - see description in attribute table below\navgSpdKt - average speed (knots) of the ship over the on-effort segment traveled\navgBft - average Beaufort Sea State over the on-effort segment\n\nOther data not included here:\nPhotos and biopsy samples were collected during some sightings. Acoustic detections were recorded from a towed hydrophone array. Sonobuoys were deployed opportunistically. A High-frequency Acoustic Recording Package (HARP) was deployed off Wake Island. Oceanographic data were collected (CTD, XBT, continuous plankton recorder).",

    "description": "The dynamics of the fish communities of the Sundarbans are poorly understood. Although there are many published works on the fish fauna of different states of India including that of West Bengal, there is no comprehensive account of the fishes recorded from the Sundarbans. However, the works of Talwar et al. (1992); Mukherjee (1995); Das and Nandi (1999); and Gopal and Chauhan (2006) report the fish diversity of the Sundarbans. Compilations of the species listed in these works reveal that 364 species distributed under 215 genera are available in the Sundarbans as against 4,494 genera world over.",

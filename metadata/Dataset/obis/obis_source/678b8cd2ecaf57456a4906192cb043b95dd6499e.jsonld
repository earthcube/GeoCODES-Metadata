    "description": "This dataset is three comma-separated values (csv) files containing fish haul information collected during trawl surveys in the Chukchi Sea during the 9 August - 3 September 2015 Arctic Marine Biodiversity Observing Network (AMBON) research cruise. Tables describe haul event information, species occurrence per haul, and fish morphometric information. Fish were collected with a plump-staff beam trawl and Isaac-Kidds midwater trawl, identified to species, and their life stage, length, and weight were measured and recorded. The data was transformed from the native format into a table structure using Darwin Core terms and organized in the OBIS-ENV-DATA format.",

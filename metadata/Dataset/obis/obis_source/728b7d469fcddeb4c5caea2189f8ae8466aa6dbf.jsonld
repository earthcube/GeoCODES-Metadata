    "description": "This dataset contains marine mammal observation data conducted during shipboard transects in the Chukchi Sea during the 5 August - 25 August 2017 Arctic Marine Biodiversity Observing Network (AMBON) research cruise. The dataset is two comma-separated values (csv) files exported from the marine bird and mammal observation software WinCruz from the entire survey. One data file contains the dates,times, latitude, longitude, species and best-high-low estimates of numbers for cetacean (whales) and pinniped (seals, seal lions, and walrus) sightings. The second data file contains the track of the ship (as geographic coordinates) and the Beaufort sea state at two minute intervals as a measurement of effort. This dataset was transformed from the native format into a table structure using Darwin Core Archive (DwC-A, occurrence core) term names as column names.",

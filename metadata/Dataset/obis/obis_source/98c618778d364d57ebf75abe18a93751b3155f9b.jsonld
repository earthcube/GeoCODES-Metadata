    "description": "The Rooms museum contains several marine collections. This current dataset contains a very small subset of the museum's ichthyology collection. The OBIS dataset contains records associated with silverside specimens (<i>Menidia menidia</i>) sent to the Newfoundland Museum. These samples were originally collected as part of a project with the objective to determine the distributional ranges and phylogeographic origins of several species in coastal Newfoundland waters.",

    "description": "Original provider:\nNew York State Department of Environmental Conservation\n\nDataset credits:\nNew York State Department of Environmental Conservation\n\nAbstract:\nThe New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Division of \nMarine Resources contracted Tetra Tech to conduct aerial whale monitoring in \nthe New York Bight (NYB). Monitoring consisted of 36 monthly line-transect \naerial surveys starting in March 2017 and ending in February 2020. The NYB \nsurvey area is a 43,449 square kilometer area of ocean from the south shore of \nLong Island to the continental shelf break. These surveys focused on six large \nwhale species: the blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus), fin whale (B. \nphysalus), humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), North Atlantic right \nwhale (Eubalaena glacialis), sei whale (B. borealis), and sperm whale \n(Physeter macrocephalus). This longitudinal multi-year study provides new \ninsight into the occurrence, relative abundance, behavior, and densities and \nabundance of the six large whale species, as well as the occurrence other \nmarine species, in the NYB.\n\nA total of 733.1 hours and 149,482 kilometers of flight time were completed \nover 263 survey flights. Observations were conducted by two observers from a \nhigh-winged, twin-engine Partenavia aircraft; one observer was positioned on \neach side of the aircraft and looked through bubble windows. Data recorded \nincluded all parameters required to estimate density and abundance using \ndistance sampling techniques. A total of 3,069 sightings of 37,410 estimated \nindividuals were recorded, including all six large whale species, other marine \nmammals, sea turtles, and other marine species (i.e., sharks, rays, fish \nschools, etc.). \n\nFurther details may be found in the Final Comprehensive Report at \nwww.dec.ny.gov/docs/fish_marine_pdf/mmaeran3.pdf and the associated \nreferences.\n\nPurpose:\nThe primary goals of the aerial surveys were: \n(1) Determine the distribution and estimate relative abundance and density of \nthe six large whale species; \n(2) Determine monthly and seasonal occurrence, and inter-annual variability \nof the distribution and estimated abundance, density, and relative abundance \nfor the six species;\n(3) Record data about the behavior of sighted large whales; \n(4) Record opportunistic sightings of sea turtles and other marine species; and\n(5) Record relevant environmental variables.\n\nSupplemental information:\nEnvironmental data are available and included in the downloadable zipped file.",

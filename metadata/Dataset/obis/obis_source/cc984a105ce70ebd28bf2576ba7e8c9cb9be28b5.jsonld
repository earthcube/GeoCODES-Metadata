    "description": "In January 1949, as a result of continued concern over declining abundance of stocks throughout the Northwest Atlantic, the International Convention for the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries (ICNAF) was established.  The stated purpose of the Convention was the investigation, protection and conservation of the fisheries. For a history of this organization please refer to Emory D. Anderson J. yyyy\n\nThe ICNAF NORWESTLANT Surveys took place during April to July 1963.  The dates of the three surveys which were carried out were as follows:\nNORWESTLANT 1: 31 March - 9 May\nNORWESTLANT 2: 30 April - 30 June\nNORWESTLANT 3: 30 June - 3 August\n\nThe object of the study was to give an account of the distribution of zooplankton which may be relevant to the distribution and survival of cod and redfish larvae. The dataset concerns a very wide area and is not intended as a comprehensive review of the zooplankton. In addition to plankton distribution the expedition reports also contains a short section on marine mammal observations.\n\nThis resource contains data extracts from the published report for fish eggs and larvae.",

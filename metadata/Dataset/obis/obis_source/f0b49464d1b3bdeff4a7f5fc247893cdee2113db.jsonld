    "description": "Surveys of coral community structure, composition and diversity were carried out at nearshore reefs of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. 466 sites on 96 reefs between Mackay and Cooktown (latitude 14-21 degrees South) were surveyed between 1994 and 1997. The aim of the study was to characterize nearshore coral communities in this region. Hard corals were identified to species level and rated by relative abundance. Total Distribution Records: 16,489 Total Number of Taxa: 69 genera, 285 species",

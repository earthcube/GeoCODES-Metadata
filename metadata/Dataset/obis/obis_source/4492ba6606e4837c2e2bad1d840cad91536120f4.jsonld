    "description": "BCCM/ULC is a small and dedicated public culture collection, currently containing one of the largest collections of documented (sub)polar cyanobacteria worldwide.\nThe BCCM/ULC collection is hosted by the Centre for Protein Engineering (the Unit) of the University of Liège. The host Unit is very active in research projects concerning the cyanobacterial diversity and biogeography, with a focus on polar biotopes. The approach used is polyphasic, including the isolation of strains and culture-independent methods (DGGE, clone libraries, pyrosequencing based on the ribosomal operon sequences). The participation to field expeditions in the Antarctic and Arctic has enabled to collect samples in many locations. Moreover, taxonomic research is carried out by the host Unit to improve the classification of the cyanobacterial phylum. It is based on a polyphasic approach combining the morphological and molecular characterizations of the strains.",

    "description": "Biological data collected on Southern Surveyor voyage SS 01/91. This voyage took place in waters off the west coast of Western Australia during 21 January - 19 February 1991, under the leadership of Anthony Koslow, as part of the Western Australia coast deepwater invertebrate study. Biological data collected on this cruise include extensive collections of fish, crustaceans (including scampi and deep-water prawns), and cephalopods from 95 trawls. Photographic records were also taken of the specimens and acoustic data were continuously collected during the cruise.\nReports, metadata and other data from this voyage are at https://www.marine.csiro.au/data/trawler/survey_details,cfm?survey=SS199101\nThis data has been republished (2022-09-05 with additional details of each occurrence where they can be one of three types:  catch composition (counts per taxa and optional aggregated weights by trawl event), catch measurements (length and/or weight) of individual taxa and/or catch specimens and their stored location. The occurrence type is recorded in occurrenceremarks.\n\n",

    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA National Centers for Environmental Information\n\nDataset credits:\nErrol Ronje, NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information\nTexas Marine Mammal Stranding Network\nNational Marine Fisheries Service Southeast Fisheries Science Center\n\nAbstract:\nAs part of the marine mammal stock assessment program of the National \nMarine Fisheries Service (NMFS), photographic identification capture mark \nrecapture data were collected to estimate the abundance of common \nbottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) by the Southeast Fisheries \nScience Center, Pascagoula, Mississippi Laboratory, and the Texas Marine \nMammal Stranding Network from 2014-03-29 to 2019-06-28.  This dataset \nincludes spatiotemporal data for visual observations and dorsal fin images \nfor individual dolphins encountered in the coastal and estuarine waters of \nnorth Texas and western Louisiana including East Matagorda Bay, West \nBay, Galveston Bay, and Sabine Lake.\n\nPurpose:\nThe Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 requires the National Marine \nFisheries Service (NMFS) to report the status of all marine mammal stocks in \nUSA waters.  The primary purpose of this dataset was to collect common  \nbottlenose dolphin encounter data for capture-mark-recapture abundance \nestimation models and to assess the spatial distribution of the dolphin group \nencounters to inform stock assessment reports in three NMFS designated \nstock areas: West Bay, Galveston Bay, and Sabine Lake.\n\nSupplemental information:\nFin images are included in the downloadable zipped file.",

    "description": "In 2012, a sample collected in Cape Breton at Johnston Harbour in the Bras d'Or Lake revealed presence of a Dinophyceae, Coolia monotis Meunier. This species had not previously been reported from this area and subsequently several sites in Cape Breton and on the eastern shore of Nova Scotia were sampled to determine species distribution. Samples were collected in shallow water (&lt;0.5m depth) and later analysed in the laboratory for presence of C. monotis. This dataset does not contain quantitative information - recorded observations indicate presence/absence at a specific location. Date of the sampling event is included in the dataset.",

    "description": "This is the OBIS extraction of the OTN West River, Sheet Harbour, Brook Trout project, consisting only of the release tagging metadata. i.e. the locations  and dates of tagged animal release. If readers are  interested in the full source  dataset they should refer to the OTN web site  (members.oceantrack.org). Abstract: This project examined the estuarine migration, behaviour, habitat use and general ecology of brook charr while in estuarine and coastal habitats. This was a two year project (2009 &amp; 2010) and ran concurrent to the West River Sheet Harbour Atlantic Salmon smolt tracking project (WRS).",

    "description": "Original provider:\nUniversity of Liverpool\n\nDataset credits:\nDr. Louise Soanes, University of Roehampton, UK\nDr. Jonathan Green, University of Liverpool, UK\nDr. Jenny Bright, Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, UK\nMs. Farah Mukhida, Anguilla National Trust\nMs. Susan Zaluski, Jost Van Dykes Preservation Society, British Virgin Islands\n\nAbstract:\nThe UK Overseas Territories of Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands are located in the north-west Lesser Antilles. Whilst mainland Anguilla lacks any large breeding seabird populations, its offshore cays excel in this area and are home to five globally and 12 regionally important populations. Four of Anguilla’s seven offshore cays are already designated as terrestrial important bird areas (IBAs) due to their important seabird colonies, with Dog Island being the second most important site for breeding seabirds in the region. The British Virgin Islands (composed of 60 cays) support two globally important populations of Magnificent frigatebird and Roseate tern and have three IBAs designated for breeding seabird populations. This study uses GPS tracking data collected from the guild of globally and regionally important seabird populations breeding within these two Territories to identify important foraging areas, and relate these to oceanographic variables and potential threats such as fishing activity and coastal/marine developments.\n\nThis project is being led by the University of Liverpool (UK) in collaboration with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, Anguilla National Trust, Jost Van Dyke Preservation Society and British Virgin Islands National Parks Trust, with support from the Anguillan Government’s Fisheries and Marine Resources Department and the BVI Conservation and Fisheries Department, and funded by the UK’s Darwin Plus Initiative.\n\nPurpose:\nThis project aimed to:\n(1) identify key feeding areas of seabirds using GPS technology,\n(2) establish and support long-term monitoring strategies in Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands, and\n(3) identify current and future threats facing seabird populations in Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands.",

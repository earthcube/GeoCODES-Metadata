    "description": "This major Australian collection encompasses more than 30,000 specimens, many relating to Victoria's history. It is significant not only due to its size but also because many items are of historical and continuing scientific value.\nIn particular the collection emphasises Victorian mammal distribution, both past and present; mammal biology and ecology; representatives of Australian and non-Australian faunas; historical collections obtained on scientific expeditions; and practical applications of science relating to the history of Victoria.\nThe collection also includes a remarkable number of specimens from locations around the world. In total, more than 1000 species of mammals are represented.\nThis dataset is restricted to marine taxa and are matched to the World Register of marine Species.",

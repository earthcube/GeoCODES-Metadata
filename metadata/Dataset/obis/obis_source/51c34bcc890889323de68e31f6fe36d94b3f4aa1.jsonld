    "description": "During the summer of 1962 an arthropod-mollusk survey was conducted in the environs of Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada. Results of this study were provided to the New Brunswick Provincial Health Department, Fredericton in January, 1967.\nAs part of an Atlantic Ecosystem Initiative data rescue activity species distribution information associated with this study published by Coleman (1967) was digitized. This article does not contain the full source dataset - it simply lists the collection areas and specimen types taken from each area. The location of these sampling sites was georeferenced as part of the data rescue activity.",

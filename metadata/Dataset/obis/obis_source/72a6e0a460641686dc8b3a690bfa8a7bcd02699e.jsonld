    "description": "To capture spatial and temporal variability in site characteristics (in terms of temperature, salinity and flow), abundance of Carcinus maenas, Cancer irroratus, and Dyspanopeus sayi were measured in June (spring), August (summer) and October (autumn) 2005 and 2006, using snorkeling or SCUBA diving depending on depth. The thesis experiment ran from 19 June to 15 October 2006, covering almost the entire growing season of C. irroratus.\n\nThis version of the resource contains simple presence of two species at three locations in the Bras d'Or Lakes.",

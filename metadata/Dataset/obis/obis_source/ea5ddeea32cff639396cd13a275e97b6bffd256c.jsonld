    "description": "Cryptic species in coral reefs, such as sea slugs, represent and contribute an important portion of their biodiversity, which is usually underestimated. Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS) have been implemented to estimate cryptic diversity in coral reefs. Therefore, this research aimed to contribute to the southern Gulf of Mexico (GM) and the Caribbean Sea (CAR) coral reefs sea slugs’ diversity and distribution using ARMS as a collection method. 58 ARMS were placed at three coral reefs in the GM and CAR, recovered after 1-2 years and then, disassembled at the laboratory. Plates were individually placed in trays with seawater, where we searched for sea slugs. A total of 242 organisms were found belonging to 37 species; 20 of them were identified to species level, while 17 were determined up to genus or family. More than half of the species (24) were found in Bajo de 10 (GM), while 16 species were found in the CAR localities. Unlike previous studies, we assessed sea slugs’ diversity exclusively by an indirect sampling method. In this work we found 11.2% of the sea slug diversity recorded in the Caribbean, and we report 20 species for the first time in the country. New records of species, and even one family for the GM stress the gap of information that we still need to fulfill in the area. We recognize ARMS as a useful tool to find juvenile, cryptic, and rare species of sea slugs, as well as to standardize their quantification and record their diversity.",

    "description": "Original provider:\nRandall Wells, Sarasota Dolphin Research Program\n\nDataset credits:\nSarasota Dolphin Research Program\n\nAbstract:\nThe Sarasota Dolphin Research Program has been conducting research on bottlenose dolphins along the west coast of Florida since 1970.  During the 1970s, sighting data came primarily from surveys searching for tagged dolphins, from radio-tracking, and from a few photographic identification efforts (Irvine et al. 1981; Wells et al. 1980).  From 1980-1992, data came primarily from seasonal, systematic photographic identification surveys (Wells et al. 1987, Wells and Scott 1990, Scott et al. 1990, Wells 1991).   Focused photographic identification surveys of the Gulf of Mexico waters offshore of Sarasota Bay, Florida, occurred during July 1997 through August 1998 (Fazioli et al. 2006).  Building on these, biopsy darting and photo-ID occurred in the same waters during 1999-2000 (Sellas et al. 2000).  Photographic identification surveys were conducted in and immediately offshore of Tampa Bay during 1988-1993 (Wells et al. 1996a).   Photographic identification surveys were conducted in and immediately offshore of Lemon Bay and Charlotte Harbor during 1990-1994 (Wells et al. 1996b) and during 2000-2004 and 2006 (unpubl.).   Photographic identification surveys were conducted in and immediately offshore of Pine Island Sound during 1996 (Wells et al. 1997) and during 2000-2004 and 2006 (unpubl.).  Monthly photographic identification surveys have continued from 1993 to the present for Sarasota Bay and Gulf waters immediately offshore from Passage Key Inlet to Venice Inlet (Wells 2003); these have been supplemented through focal animal behavioral follows, some radio-tracking, and additional biopsy darting efforts (Owen et al. 2002).  Data provided include sighting date, location code, latitude and longitude of first observation, and best estimate of number of dolphins present (following photo-analysis) for SDRP sightings in the Gulf of Mexico.  More details on data collection and processing techniques are available in the SDRP manual available as a download from: www.sarasotadolphin.org.

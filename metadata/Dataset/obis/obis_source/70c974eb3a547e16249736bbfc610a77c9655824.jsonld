    "description": "Original provider:\nJaime Bolaños-Jiménez\n\nDataset credits:\nJaime Bolaños-Jiménez\n\nAbstract:\nReported occurrences of the killer whale (<i>Orcinus orca</i>) off Venezuela are scarce. Eighteen records were opportunistically collected from April 1982 through January 2008. Bottom depth for the sightings was 10-1,500 m (mean = 444 + SD = 405; mode = 400, n = 18). Five records had available associated still photographs or video. Noteworthy was a videotaped attack by two killer whales on a leatherback turtle (<i>Dermochelys coriacea</i>). Group size ranged from 1-5 individuals (mean = 2.67 + SD = 1.57; mode = 1,  n = 18). Adult males were present during 67% of reported sightings; females/juveniles were present in 61% (n = 12 and 11, respectively). Pictures of two male killer whales were sent to researchers in Brazil and the Bahamas for comparison purposes. Adult males were present in 92% of reported sightings. Females and juveniles were observed during 67% of reported sightings. 83% of the records were from December through May. There is currently not enough information to speculate on any seasonality to the occurrence of this species in Venezuelan waters.\n\nPurpose:\nThe purpose of this work was to update information on killer whale occurrences in Venezuelan waters, on the basis of opportunistic sightings and/or pictures provided by non-professional observers.\n\nSupplemental information:\nA few records did not record day or day and month. For these records, month and day fields were filled with 1. A note was added to [remarks] field, which may be released upon the data provider's permission.",

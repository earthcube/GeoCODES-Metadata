    "description": "Scallop shells are often colonized by a variety of epibionts to both deleterious and advantageous effect. In June 1998, samples were collected during the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) scallop stock survey of scallop production areas SPA4 and SPA1 in the Bay of Fundy.  \n\nScallops (Placopecten magellanicus Gmelin, 1791) with epibiotic growth were sampled at stations selected to represent each of four bottom types (rock, gravel, shell hash, sand). All organisms attached to the shell or other organisms within the epifaunal community were identified and quantified where possible. This resource contains only the presence/absence of epibionts associated with this study (Magee et al, 2000).\n\nThe information associated with this study was standardized and republished as part of the Atlantic Coastal Zone Information Steering Committee (ACZISC) Atlantic Ecosystem Initiative (AEI) funded project “Atlantic Canada’s Biological Data for Ecosystem Planning and Decision-making” and OBIS Canada.",

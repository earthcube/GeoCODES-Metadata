    "description": "The field study was conducted on Montague Island (−36.253°, 150.227°), 9 km off the southeast coast of New South Wales, Australia, in September, November and December 2012–2014. This dataset consists of 166 tracks from adult little penguins (Eudyptula minor) covering the peak of the little penguin’s breeding season.\nThe analysis of tracks versus ocean properties is in Carroll, G., Everett, J., Harcourt, R. et al.

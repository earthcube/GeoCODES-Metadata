    "name": "A detailed benthic faunal and introduced marine species survey of Port Davey, Bathurst Channel and Bathurst Harbour in SW Tasmania, Australia (2007)",
    "description": "In February/ April 2007 invertebrate faunal communities were sampled at 70 locations throughout the system â€“ with the greatest intensity of sites located within Port Davey, Bathurst Channel and Bathurst Harbour.\nDepth was measured from the surface using a depth sounder. Benthic invertebrate communities were sampled from the surface using an Eckman grab (in silty and muddy sediments) or a Van Veen grab in sandy sediments. At each site three replicate grab samples were collected and amalgamated in the field after sieving through a 1.0 mm mesh sieve then fixed in buffered 10% formalin seawater solution. An additional grab sample was collected for sediment physical and chemical analysis (C. Reid, Queens University, Canada). Surface and bottom water salinity were recorded at each location using a conductivity-salinity probe (not included in this dataset). The geographical position of each site was marked using GPS.\nFurther details and the orginal data is from https://metadata.imas.utas.edu.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/metadata.show?uuid=edbb8a4a-34c3-4e1a-8278-1c45978b85c1",

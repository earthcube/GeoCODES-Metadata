    "description": "Collected by RMT trawls during ANARE 1990/91 Voyage 6 AAMBER2 survey. 62 routine sampling sites were taken within the area 67 degrees to 78 degrees East, 65 degrees South to the Antarctic coastline, in a grid arrangement with approximately 30 nautical miles in latitude and longitude between sites. At each site the 0-200m water layer was sampled by a downward oblique haul with a rectangular midwater trawl RMT 1+8 net. Ten horizontal tows were also made with the RMT 1+8 to identify krill/zooplankton targets detected by the echosounders.",

    "description": "Phyllosoma samples were collected on board the RV Investigator from 3 to 18 June 2015, Tasman Sea A total of 34 stations were sampled, with either a multiple opening and closing net and environmental sensing system (MOCNESS; diameter 1 m2, mesh 500 mm), a neuston net (surface tow net; diameter 1 m2, mesh 500 mm) or a rectangular mid-water trawl (RMT) net (diameter 1.13 m2, meshÂ¼1000 mm; Table 1). All nets were fitted with 500-mm mesh codends. Tow duration was 10 min per haul for the MOCNESS and neuston nets and 30 min per haul for the RMT net. At each sampling station, hauls from either two to four MOCNESS and two neuston nets, or three RMT nets were conducted and live sorted immediately upon landing. All phyllosoma and postlarval lobster stages found in those hauls were preserved in 70% ethanol and stored at 80 deg C.\nVoyage details (metadata, projects, other datasets either online or as downloads, publications and reports, events, maps etc) can be accessed at https://www.marine.csiro.au/data/trawler/survey_details.cfm?survey=IN2015_V03\nIf this data has been used in any products, please acknowledge with the following: We acknowledge the use of the CSIRO Marine National Facility (https://ror.org/01mae9353) in undertaking this research.\n\n",

    "description": "Original provider:\nObservatoire PELAGIS - Reseau National Echouage (French stranding network) - UAR 3462 University La Rochelle - CNRS\n\nDataset credits:\nObservatoire PELAGIS UAR 3462, University La Rochelle - CNRS- Agence des Aires Marines Protégées - Direction de l'Eau et de la Biodiversité\n\nAbstract:\nThe French stranding network is co-ordinated by the Joint Service Unit PELAGIS, UAR 3462, University of La Rochelle-CNRS, dedicated to monitoring marine mammal and seabird populations, as a continuous monitoring programme. The network is constituted of around 300 trained volunteers distributed along the whole French coast who collect data according to a standardized observation and dissection protocol. The network was established in the early 1970’s and its organisation and procedures are considered unchanged since the mid 1980’s. Data are centralized into a single database held in La Rochelle.\n\nPurpose:\nWith  over  23,000  entries,  the  stranding  data  base  documented since  1970  by  the  French  stranding  network  provides  one  of  the largest  dataset  on  cetaceans  in  Europe.  Stranding  data  would  rank high  in  cost-effectiveness  compared  to  most  other  sources  of  data on  cetaceans  because  they  are  do  not  require  to  any  expensive field  work  at  sea.  As  a  result  of  their  comparatively  low  cost  per unit  effort,  stranding  data  can  be  collected  across  wide  spatial and  temporal  ranges  and  at  fine  resolution.  For  scientific  purposes,  the  term  “stranding”  is  commonly  used  for  either  live  or\ndead  specimen.\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2022-01-18] Data in 2020 were appended.\n[2018-04-26] Records in 2016 were appended.\n[2017-01-05] Records in 2015 were appended.\n\nTime and group size of the sightings are not available online. They may be released upon request.",

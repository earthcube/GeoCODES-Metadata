    "description": "This dataset contains zooplankton species biomass and abundance data collected in the Chukchi Sea during the 9 August - 3 September 2015 Arctic Marine Biodiversity Observing Network (AMBON) research cruise on the vessel Norseman II. This dataset contains three comma separate values (csv) files. The data were collected from zooplankton samples caught with traditional 150Âµm plankton nets and taxonomically identified. Each data file include the location, date, time, depth, and identification of zooplankton taxa collected during the 2015 AMBON cruise. The data in the file named AMBON2015_Zooplankton_Abundance_150_DC.csv and AMBON2015_505_Zooplankton_Abundance_DWC.csv consists of abundance per taxon of zooplankton. The data in the file named AMBON2015_Zooplankton_Biomass_150_DC.csv and AMBON2015_505_Zooplankton_Biomass_DWC.csv consists of biomass per taxon of zooplankton. These data files are presented in a table structure using Darwin Core term names as column names. This dataset also contains the file AMBON_station_masterlist.csv, describing stations sampled during AMBON cruises.",

    "description": "This dataset has 1728 observations representing 54 taxonomic categories from the southeastern Beaufort Sea. This dataset was used to study the zooplankton communities in southeastern Beaufort Sea in September-October 2002. At each of the 35 stations of the CASES (Canadian Arctic Shelf Exchange Study) 2002 sampling grid, a 200 µm-mesh net tow was carried out.",

    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nNOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC)\n\nAbstract:\nAs part of the AMAPPS program, the Southeast Fisheries \nScience Center conducted aerial surveys of continental \nshelf waters (up to the 200 m isobath) along the US east \ncoast from New Jersey to Florida between 3 July - 9 \nAugust, 2016. The survey was flown aboard a NOAA Twin \nOtter aircraft at an altitude of 600 feet (183 m) and a \nspeed of 110 knots. The survey path followed tracklines \noriented perpendicular to the shoreline and latitudinally \nspaced 20 km apart. “Fine-scale” track lines were \nsurveyed \nin waters off the coast of New Jersey, Delaware and \nVirginia. The survey was designed for analysis using \nDistance sampling and a two-team (independent observer) \napproach to correct for visibility bias in resulting \nabundance estimates.\n\nPurpose:\nThe goal of the surveys was to conduct line-transect \nsurveys using the Distance sampling approach to estimate \nthe abundance and spatial distribution of marine mammals \nand turtles in waters over the continental shelf of the \neastern US.\n\nSupplemental information:\nPerpendicular distance to the animal is not publicly \navailable.\nThe dataset is accompanied by transect (effort) data \nwhich is provided as a separate file.\nSightings included were detected on-effort by the forward \nteam \nonly; you may request the full dataset and sightings \nincluding opportunistic ones directly to the provider.\n\nEnvironmental Attribute Codes\nBeaufort Sea state\n0 Calm, mirror like seas\n1 Waves &lt;1ft, rippled surface\n2 Small wavelets (&lt;2 ft), no white caps\n3 Large wavelets (&lt;3ft), scattered white caps\n4 Swell 3-4 ft, numerous white caps\n5 Swell &gt;5 ft, many white caps, some spray\n6 Swell &gt;10 ft, white caps everywhere, spray\nCloudCover\n0 Clear\n1 0-25% Cloudy\n2 26-50% Cloudy\n3 51-75% Cloudy\n4 76-100% Cloudy\n5 Overcast\nGlare (Glare intensity)\n0 No Impairment\n1 Slight Impairment\n2 Moderate Impairment\n3 Severe Impairment\nWeather\n0 Clear\n1 Mist\n2 Light Rain\n3 Heavy Rain\nConditions\n0 Poor\n1 Fair\n2 Moderate\n3 Good\n4 Excellent\nHaze\n0 No\n1 Yes\nFog\n0 No\n1 Yes\nSun penetration (Sun pen)\n0 Poor\n1 Fair\n2 Good\n3 Excellent\nTurbidity\n0 Poor\n1 Fair\n2 Good\n3 Excellent",

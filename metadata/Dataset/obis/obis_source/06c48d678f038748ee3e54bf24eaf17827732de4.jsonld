    "description": "Fish species abundance data and species-specific length and weight data was collected in the Gulf of Alaska using a midwater trawl net. These data were collected as part of the International Year of the Salmon (IYS) High Seas Expedition conducted in March and April 2020, to further improve the understanding of factors impacting salmon marine winter survival. Trawl sets were conducted using a research trawl net with a 3 mm codend mesh size. A total of 52 tows were conducted, and for each tow the total species-specific weight and catch numbers were recorded. This dataset only contains data on salmonids and larger bycatch species that have been identified to a species level and verified by the data provider. A total of 566 salmon were caught in 29 out of 52 trawl sets, including 234 Chum Salmon, 118 Coho Salmon, 51 Sockeye Salmon, 136 Pink Salmon, 26 Chinook Salmon and 1 Steelhead Trout. All salmon were identified to species level, fitted with a floy tag on the caudal peduncle (to identify the specimen) and measured for fork length, standard length and weight. Where possible, sex and maturation stage are recorded. Larger bycatch species are enumerated, and their length (fork, total, standard, mantle or bell diameter), wet weight, sex and maturation stage (where possible) is recorded.",

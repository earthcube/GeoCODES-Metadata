    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nMarine Mammal and Turtle Division, Southwest Fisheries Science Center, NMFS, NOAA\n\nAbstract:\nThis 1987 eastern tropical Pacific cetacean line-transect survey was the second in a series of annual surveys (1986-1990) designed to monitor and detect trends in populations of dolphins killed in the yellowfin tuna purse seine fishery. This survey was conducted by the NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center aboard NOAA ships <i>David Starr Jordan</i> and <i>McArthur</i> for a combined total of approximately 29,000 kilometers surveyed from late July to early December 1987. This dataset provides the time-date and geographical coordinates, by species/stock, of all cetaceans detected during the survey, as well as the daily and intra-daily start and end points of the line-transect survey by the NOAA Ship <i>McArthur</i>.\n\nPurpose:\nThe primary purpose of the survey was to collect the information necessary to calculate the relative abundance of those dolphin stocks in the eastern tropical Pacific that are taken as a bycatch of the yellowfin tuna purse seine fishery.\n\nSupplemental information:\nThis dataset is supplemental to the following datasets: \nSWFSC Marine Mammal Survey, MOPS 1986, Cruise 989\nSWFSC Marine Mammal Survey, MOPS 1986, Cruise 990\nSWFSC Marine Mammal Survey, MOPS 1987, Cruise 1081\nSWFSC Marine Mammal Survey, MOPS 1988, Cruise 1164\nSWFSC Marine Mammal Survey, MOPS 1988, Cruise 1165\nSWFSC Marine Mammal Survey, MOPS 1989, Cruise 1267\nSWFSC Marine Mammal Survey, MOPS 1989, Cruise 1268\nSWFSC Marine Mammal Survey, MOPS 1990, Cruise 1369\nSWFSC Marine Mammal Survey, MOPS 1990, Cruise 1370\nSWFSC Marine Mammal Survey, STAR 1998, Cruise 1610\nSWFSC Marine Mammal Survey, STAR 1998, Cruise 1611\nSWFSC Marine Mammal Survey, STAR 1998, Cruise 1612\nSWFSC Marine Mammal Survey, STAR 1999, Cruise 1613\nSWFSC Marine Mammal Survey, STAR 1999, Cruise 1614\nSWFSC Marine Mammal Survey, STAR 2000, Cruise 1615\nSWFSC Marine Mammal Survey, STAR 2000, Cruise 1616\nSWFSC Marine Mammal Survey, STAR 2003, Cruise 1623\nSWFSC Marine Mammal Survey, STAR 2003, Cruise 1624\nSWFSC Marine Mammal Survey, STAR 2006, Cruise 1630\nSWFSC Marine Mammal Survey, STAR 2006, Cruise 1631\nSWFSC Marine Mammal Survey, STAR-LITE 2007, Cruise 1634",

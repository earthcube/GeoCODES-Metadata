Four nesting females were tracked in 2003 and made impressive movements north, using waters as far away as New Jersey.  Two of the transmitters are still transmitting.  The transmitters provided us with some very useful and interesting novel information about the migratory and foraging behaviour and natural history of the loggerhead sea turtle in North Carolina. This summer's deployments will complement last seasons results and provide us with a wider insight into North Carolina sea turtle biology.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=25\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

    "description": "Original provider:\nBureau of Ocean Energy Management\n\nDataset credits:\nTexas A&amp;M University\nOregon State University\nScripps Institution of Oceanography\nTexas A&amp;M University-Galveston\nUniversity of Colorado\nUniversity of Durham\nUniversity of Saint Andrews\nUniversity of South Florida\nWoods Hole Oceanographic Institution\n\nAbstract:\nSperm Whale Seismic Study (SWSS) was a multi-institutional, interdisciplinary research project supported by the then Minerals Management Service (MMS; now Bureau of Ocean Energy Management - BOEM) under Cooperative Agreement 1435-01-02-CA-85186 for Cooperative Research on Sperm Whales and their Response to Seismic Exploration in the Gulf of Mexico through the Texas A&amp;M Research Foundation.\n\nThe objectives of SWSS were to\n(1) establish baseline information on the biology and behavior of sperm whales in the northern Gulf of Mexico,\n(2) characterize sperm whale habitat use in the northern Gulf of Mexico, and\n(3) determine possible changes in behavior of sperm whales when subjected to manmade noise, particularly from seismic airgun arrays used for offshore oil and gas exploration and geological monitoring.\n\nSupplemental information:\n2015-11-17: Two records having a negative number of the animal count (2002-07-06 21:16:34 and 2003-07-07 15:04:46) were fixed to positive numbers.\n\nThis dataset includes sperm whale visual tracking data in 2002-2004. Sightings of other cetaceans are found in <a href=\"/dataset/903\">BOEM Sperm Whale Seismic Study (SWSS) S-Tag cetacean sightings 2002-2004</a>\n\nSince the vessels often tracked the sighted sperm whales for further surveys, many sightings in this dataset represent the same animals.\n\nSince the 2005 data are in a different format, they are registered separately as <a href=\"/dataset/905\">BOEM Sperm Whale Seismic Study (SWSS) S-Tag cetacean sightings 2005</a>\n\nEffort data were filtered to eliminate early morning and night times where no visual efforts were conducted. The of-effort times are different in years.\n2002: 06:30 - 19:30 CDT\n2003 SH: 05:50 - 19:30 CDT\n2003 STag: 06:30 - 20:30 CDT\n2004: 07:00 â€“ 20:00 CDT",

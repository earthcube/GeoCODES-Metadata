    "description": "This resource contains species distribution records extracted from the Fisheries and Oceans Canada BioChem database for the BioChem 'Harris_0_100m' series of records.  This collection contains zooplankton abundance and distribution information for locations across the Scotian Shelf and the Labrador Sea.  Samples were collected from 100 m to the surface using a 75 cm diameter conical net of 202 micron mesh towed vertically through the water column. \n\nSample analysis results, archived in the BioChem database, include abundance and biomass for larger taxonomic groups, by genera for most of the copepod taxa and by stages for the three large Calanus species (C. finmarchicus, C. glacialis and C. hyperboreus).  This OBIS resource contains a subset of these database records - at this time only abundance information has been released.",

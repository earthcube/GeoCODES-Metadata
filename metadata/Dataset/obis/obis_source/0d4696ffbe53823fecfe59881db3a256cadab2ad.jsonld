    "description": "This nation-wide dataset contains data on cetacean strandings recorded on the Ukrainian coast of the Black sea by researchers from a few institutions and personally reported by local residents and visitors, with photographs. Creation of the dataset was recommended by the Research Council on Marine Mammal Protection and the Ministry of Ecology and National Resources of Ukraine. Some field activities in 2017 were funded by the ACCOBAMS (project “Identification and initial assessment of cetacean groupings in coastal waters of the north-western Black Sea, Ukrainian sector”)",

    "description": "In 1982 the Arctic Laboratories were commissioned to undertake a combined chemical, biological and physical oceanographic survey from March 1981 to April 1982 in the vicinity of the Issungnak O-61 artificial island. Because of its position near the 20m depth contour, the island provided an ideal opportunity to study oceanographic features in a transitional zone between the more truly marine waters of the outer shelf and Mackenzie River dominated water of shallower nearshore regions.  \n\nZooplankton collection\nSampling included deployment of vertical ring nets (mesh 158 microns). This resource presents the zooplankton distribution information recorded in the study's report (Erikson et al, 1983). Occurrence records include abundance information recorded as numbers per cubic metre. \n\nIce flora and Phytoplankton collection\nIce fauna intimately associated with the ice-water interface were sampled with an ice-scraping device made from a plastic funnel (25cm diameter opening) and plankton net attached to a hinged aluminum rod. A sample consisted of revolutions of the scraper around the perimeter of the 30 cm ice auger hole.\nAll samples were preserved with acidic Lugol's solution. determination of ice flora and phytoplankton species composition and numbers were made using a Zeiss phase contrast inverted microscope at magnifications up to 625x following the Utermohl technique. Permanens slides were examined and cells identified as completely as possible. See page 11 of interim report for more information. These occurrence records are not available in this version.",

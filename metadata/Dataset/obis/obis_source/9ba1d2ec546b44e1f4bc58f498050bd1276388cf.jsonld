    "description": "Original provider:\nMare Nostrum\n\nDataset credits:\nMare Nostrum NGO, National Institute for Marine Research and Development “Grigore Antipa”\n\nAbstract:\nIn the Black Sea the cetaceans are represented by three species, Phocoena phocoena relicta, Tursiops truncatus ponticus and Delphinus delphis ponticus.\nThe main threat and cause of decline for the Black Sea dolphins are the fishing nets, so-called bycatches.\nFor protection of the dolphin populations from Romanian Black Sea area in conformity with the objectives of the „National Action Plan for Conservation of Dolphins” and „Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans of the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and contiguous Atlantic Area”, with finance from European Union true the Sectorial Operational Programme – Environment, NGO \"Mare Nostrum” started a series of activities in partenership with National Institute for Marine Research and Development \"Grigore Antipa” Constanța, Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve Authority, National Agency for Fishing and Aquaculture,\nNatural Science Museum Complex \"Dolphinarium” Constanța, Border Police Inspectorate of Constanța County.Among these activities we will present in the following study the\nsituation of strandings and by-catch of dolphins in the Romanian costal waters during 2010 and 2011. The datas were collected from the entire Romanian coast, from Sulina to Vama Veche.\nDuring the study more than 100 expeditions were done by land and water along the coast. Data collected recorded over 140 dead cetaceans and 1 alive; the maine cause of this mortality was due to drowning in the fishing nets.\nTo reduce the number of bycatched dolphins we are studing the effect of pingers (ADD/Acustic deterent devices) on cetaceans and fishes. In this order data were collected from five fishing units (Sulina, Vadu, Corbu, Midia, Costinești) equipped with these technologies. This measure of protecting the dolphins from the fishing nets is proposed also in ACCOBAMS.\n\nPurpose:\nCollecting data regarding sightings of the Black Sea cetacean at the Romanian coast.\n\nSupplemental information:\n[UPDATE] 2016 data were added on 2017-02-08\n[UPDATE] 2015 data were added on 2016-03-03\n[UPDATE] 2014 data were added on 2015-01-27\n[UPDATE] 2013 data were added on 2014-02-26\n[UPDATE] 2012 data were added on 2013-02-27\n\nObservations were made from shore.\nSupplemental boat-based observations are abailable: <a href=\"/dataset/832\">Cetaceans along Romanian Black Sea Coast by boat 2010-2011</a>\n\nAdditional references:\n<a href=\"http://www.czga.ro/pagina.php?id=1\">Romulus-Marian PAIU, Manuela Diana SAMARGIU, Mihaela CÂNDEA, Eugen ANTON. 2011.

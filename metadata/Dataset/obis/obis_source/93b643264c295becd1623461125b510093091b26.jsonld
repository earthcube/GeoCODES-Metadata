This project will track small (40-60 cm CCL) green turtles as they depart Mantanani to identify the location of the secondary foraging areas. For conservation to be successful, we aim to inform governments and conservaiton agencies of the connectivity of marine habitats with this work.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=593\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

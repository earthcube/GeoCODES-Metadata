    "name": "Monitoring of humpback whales in the Pender Bay, Kimberley region, Western Australia, Australia (2009 - 2012)",
    "description": "Systematic shorebased surveys were undertaken in 2009 and 2010 from the cliff top on the southern part of Pender Bay, Dampier Peninsula, Kimberley region, WA from the Two Moons Whale and Marine Research Base. The humpback whales use Pender Bay for a variety of purposes including calving, breeding, feeding (inferred), resting and staging. The results show the peak of the whale season to be in August with a relatively sharp increase in whale numbers occurring from mid July through to early August with whale numbers slowly decreasing from the end of August through to mid November.\nData and publications sourced from https://catalogue.data.wa.gov.au/dataset/69de08ac-ec8a-4593-9045-880651d6fbb",

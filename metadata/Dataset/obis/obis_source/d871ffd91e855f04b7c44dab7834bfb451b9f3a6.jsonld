    "description": "This dataset is from a paper which provides the first account of the ecological distribution of Ostracoda from a New Zealand harbour. Fifty-eight species are recorded in 23 subtidal (0â€“30 m) and intertidal sand and mud samples from the Waitemata Harbour, Auckland. Five associations are recognised using cluster analysis on the percentage abundance counts of total valves (live plus dead specimens). The main harbour channel from Hobsonville to Rangitoto, together with some of the subtidal flats in the outer part of the harbour, is dominated by Keijia demissa, with subdominant Munseyella aequa and M. brevis below the harbour bridge (association A) and Callistocythere neoplana and Quadracythere mediaruga above the bridge (association B). Shallow subtidal mud flats in the inner harbour (Herne Bay to Pollen Island) are dominated by Munseyella tumida and Microcytherura ?hornibrooki (association C). Intertidal mud fl ats and mangrove forest at Pollen Island and in the upper harbour have an ostracod fauna strongly dominated by Callistocythere neoplana (association D), in some places with associated Procythereis aff. lyttletonensis and Leptocythere lacustris (association E).",

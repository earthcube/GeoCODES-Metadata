    "description": "The data in this dataset results from different sampling campaigns along the Mediterranean coast of Egypt and the Suez Channel. Most samples of Polychaetes were taken using a Van Veen grab, while samples from Port Said Harbour were collected by knife and net used for collecting fauna.\n\nSpecimens including those of newly described species were deposited at the marine Reference Collection Center of National Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries, Alexandria under Code Numbers.",

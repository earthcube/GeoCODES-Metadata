    "description": "Original provider:\nCSIRO\n\nDataset credits:\nData provider\nBardi Jawi Turtle Tracking\nOriginating data center\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/\">Satellite Tracking and Analysis Tool (STAT)</a>\nProject partner\nThe Bardi Jawi Rangers use a combination of traditional knowledge and modern science to survey and research the coastline and surrounding islands. The rangers have a focus on developing long-term management plans to ensure the future biodiversity and cultural health of their country. As part of this strategy, the Bardi Jawi people declared an Indigenous Protected Areas across parts of their country on May 23, 2013. For more information visit klc.org.au.\nProject sponsor or sponsor description\nThis project has been partially supported by WAMSI (Western Australian Marine Science Institution).\n\n\nAbstract:\nThis project is a partnership between CSIRO, the Bardi Jawi rangers and the Western Australian Department of Parks &amp; Wildlife.The project aims to study the movement and feeding ecology of turtles, especially green turtles, in the Bardi Jawi Indigenous Protected Area, which is located in the Kimberley region of Western Australia. We are interested in where the turtles go, where they feed, and any other insights that we can obtain from the satellite tagged animals.The turtles were captured and tagged in the Bardi Jawi Indigenous Protected Area, which was declared in 2013. This is managed for sustainable use of natural resources, including turtles (known as goorlil by the Bardi Jawi people).\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=1091\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

    "description": "Assemblages of organic-walled dinoflagellate cysts (dinocysts) from 116 marine surface samples have been analysed to assess the relationship between the spatial distribution of dinocysts and modern local environmental conditions [e.g. sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface salinity (SSS), productivity] in the eastern Indian Ocean. \nThe investigated 116 core-top samples cover an area from Sumatra to Java, the Indonesian Throughflow, and the region off north-west to western Australia (10°N–30°S, 93°–128°E; Fig. 1). The samples represent the uppermost centimetre of the sediment and have been collected during several cruises, namely SHIVA 1990 and BARAT 1994 (RV Baruna Jaya I), FR10-95 1995 and FR2-96 1996 (RV Franklin) as well as SO184 2005 and SO189 2006 (RV Sonne).

    "name": "Tracking the common diving petrel (Pelecanoides urinatrix) from 3 sites in the Southern Ocean (2016-2019)",
    "description": "The study was conducted at three field sites representing separate populations: Ile Mayes (Kerguelen Archipelago, southern Indian Ocean, 49°280 S 69°570 E, hereafter referred to as Kerguelen); Kanowna Island (southeastern Australia, 39°100 S 148°160 E) and Mana Island (New Zealand, 41°060 S 174°460 E). In order to avoid potential bias owing to inter-annual variations, individuals from all three colonies were sampled during the same non-breeding period (November 2017–September 2018). Additional data were collected for Kerguelen (in 2015–2016 and 2016–2017) and Kanowna Island (in 2016–2017 and 2018–2019). Kerguelen is located in subantarctic waters sensu lato (between the Polar Front and the Subtropical Front), while both Kanowna and Mana Islands are located farther north, in the temperate subtropical region.\nIn total, 21 geolocation sensing data loggers (GLS) (nine in 2015–2016 and 12 in 2017–2018) were deployed on CDPs from Kerguelen, 41 (20 in 2017–2018 and 21 in 2017–2019) from Kanowna Island and 10 (in 2017–2018) from Mana Island.

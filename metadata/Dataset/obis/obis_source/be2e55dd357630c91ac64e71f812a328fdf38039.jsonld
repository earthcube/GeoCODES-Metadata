    "description": "In this dataset, tissue samples from gill and pereopods were collected from ethanol preserved anomuran specimens deposited in the referral center of the Center for Marine Living Resources and Ecology, India. The specimens were collected onboard FORV Sagar Sampada between 2016 and 2020 from shallow as well as deep-sea. A 573–629 bp fragment of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and 354–516 bp fragment of 16S rRNA was amplified and sequenced. The sequence generated is being used to support the respective species' morphological taxonomic status. It is also being used to study the phylogenetic relationship with their congeners.",

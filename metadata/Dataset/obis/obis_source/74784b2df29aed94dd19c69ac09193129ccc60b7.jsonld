Of the biota inhabiting these ecosystems, marine birds are among the most threatened. For conservation efforts targeting marine birds to be effective, quantitative information relating to their at-sea density and distribution is typically a crucial knowledge component. In this study, we generated predictive machine learning ensemble models for 13 marine bird species and 7 groups (representing 24 additional species) in Canada’s Pacific coast waters, including several species listed under Canada’s Species at Risk Act. Predictive models were based on systematic marine bird line transect survey information collected in spring, summer, and fall on Canada’s Pacific coast (2005−2008). Multiple Covariate Distance Sampling (MCDS) was used to estimate marine bird density along transect segments. Spatial and temporal environmental predictors, including remote sensing information, were used in model ensembles, which were constructed using 4 machine learning algorithms in Salford Systems Predictive Modeler v7.0 (SPM7): Random Forests, TreeNet, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines, and Classification and Regression Trees. Predictive models were subsequently combined to generate seasonal and overall predictions of areas important to marine birds based on normalized marine bird species or group richness and densities. Our results employ open access data sharing and are intended to better inform marine bird conservation efforts and management planning on Canada’s Pacific coast and for broader-scale geographic initiatives across North America and elsewhere.\n\nSupplemental information:\nMarine bird line-transect survey information collected using Distance Sampling in coastal British Columbia, Canada (2005-2008) is provided in three forms: (1) raw, unadjusted marine bird sightings; (2) for a subset of species, marine bird density estimates along 1km transect segments using Multiple Covariates Distance Sampling (MCDS), and; (3) for a subset of species, surface density estimates per ~14km2 hexagon using machine learning ensemble modeling. For data products 2 and 3, the marine bird subsets were restricted to species sighted in sufficient numbers for analysis. Surveys were completed by Raincoast Conservation Foundation.\n\n1. Raw data: raw, unadjusted sighting of marine bird species on water and in flight.

    "description": "Seabird and incidental cetacean and seal sightings were recorded during daylight hours during the moorings deployment, offshore from Brisbane, Nov 2016. This voyage was used as a trial of acquiring observations from the RV Investigator observation deck and testing the data recording system. Observations were made every ten minutes in the forward quadrant. There were 410 observations from 20 species of birds and 1 cetaceans. The commonest bird species were Pachyptila pacificus and Sterna bergii. Each species has been linked where possible to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS https://www.marinespecies.org).",

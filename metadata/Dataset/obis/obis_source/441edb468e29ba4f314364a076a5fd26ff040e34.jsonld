    "description": "Water samples were collected from the intertidal reef of Browse Island; a tropical, remote island in the Timor Sea. Aliquots from a single 20700 ml sample and multiple 2000 ml samples were filtered in various volumes (25 ml to 2000 ml) across two membrane sizes (0.20 µm and 0.45 µm). A fish metabarcoding assay was used to characterise the fish diversity within aliquots. All samples, except one, yielded fish DNA sequences. Two hundred and nine operational taxonomic units (cf. species) representing 48 fish families were identified from the complete collection of DNA contained in all samples, comparable to the 200 fish species detected using conventional surveys at this location.\nMethods are decsribed in the cited paper Bessey et al. \"Maximizing Fish Detection with eDNA Metabarcoding.\" Environmental DNA (February 20, 2020). doi:10.1002/edn3.74\nData accessed from the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA)  'Maximising fish detection with eDNA metabarcoding' collection at https://collections.ala.org.au/public/show/dr14581 on 2021-12-01",

    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nNOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC)\n\nAbstract:\nAs part of the AMAPPS program, the Southeast Fisheries \nScience Center conducted aerial surveys of continental \nshelf and slope waters from New Jersey to North Carolina \nbetween 23 November - 31 December, 2016. The survey was \nflown aboard a NOAA Twin Otter aircraft at an altitude of \n600 feet (183 m) and a speed of 110 knots. The survey \npath \nfollowed tracklines oriented perpendicular to the \nshoreline and latitudinally spaced 20 km apart. “Fine-\nscale” track lines were surveyed in waters off the coast \nof New Jersey, Delaware and Virginia. The survey was \ndesigned for analysis using Distance sampling and a two-\nteam (independent observer) approach to correct for \nvisibility bias in resulting abundance estimates. Due to \nstaffing issues, one team with four observers (left and \nright bubbles, belly and a data recorder) conducted the \nsurvey between 23-25 November. After 13 December the \nsurvey was conducted with two teams per usual protocol.\n\nPurpose:\nThe goal of the surveys was to conduct line-transect \nsurveys \nusing the Distance sampling approach to estimate the \nabundance and spatial distribution of marine mammals and \nturtles in waters over the continental shelf and slope \n(shoreline to 2,000 m isobath) of the eastern US.\n\nSupplemental information:\nPerpendicular distance to the animal is not publicly \navailable.\nThe dataset is accompanied by transect (effort) data \nwhich \nis provided as a separate file.\nSightings included were detected on-effort by the forward \nteam only; you may request the full dataset and sightings \nincluding opportunistic ones directly to the provider.\n\nEnvironmental Attribute Codes\nBeaufort Sea state\n0 Calm, mirror like seas\n1 Waves &lt;1ft, rippled surface\n2 Small wavelets (&lt;2 ft), no white caps\n3 Large wavelets (&lt;3ft), scattered white caps\n4 Swell 3-4 ft, numerous white caps\n5 Swell &gt;5 ft, many white caps, some spray\n6 Swell &gt;10 ft, white caps everywhere, spray\nCloudCover\n0 Clear\n1 0-25% Cloudy\n2 26-50% Cloudy\n3 51-75% Cloudy\n4 76-100% Cloudy\n5 Overcast\nGlare (Glare intensity)\n0 No Impairment\n1 Slight Impairment\n2 Moderate Impairment\n3 Severe Impairment\nWeather\n0 Clear\n1 Mist\n2 Light Rain\n3 Heavy Rain\nConditions\n0 Poor\n1 Fair\n2 Moderate\n3 Good\n4 Excellent\nHaze\n0 No\n1 Yes\nFog\n0 No\n1 Yes\nSun penetration (Sun pen)\n0 Poor\n1 Fair\n2 Good\n3 Excellent\nTurbidity\n0 Poor\n1 Fair\n2 Good\n3 Excellent",

    "description": "Polychaete fauna were sampled from bottom sediment during three seasons between autumn 2006 and spring 2007. Samples were taken during low tide from 7 stations at the eastern harbour of Alexandria (Egypt) at depths between 3 and 11 meters. 12 Polychaete species were encountered of which 3 are considered new in the Egyptian Mediterranean waters.\nThe collected specimens were preserved at Marine Reference Collection Center of National Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries, Alexandria, Egypt.",

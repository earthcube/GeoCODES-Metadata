    "description": "This dataset is from a paper that reports on a collection of five species of littoral to shallow water isopods from the Society Islands, French Polynesia. The material has been collected along the reefs surrounding the islands Bora Bora and Moorea. There has been no previous work published on Stenetriidae from the Society Islands, therefore it is not surprising that four of the five species obtained were undescribed. Up to now there are only two other reports on Stenetriidae from French Polynesia, dealing with three species of Stenetrium Haswell, 1881 from the Tuamotu Archipelago (Nobili 1906, 1907). One of these poorly described species, Stenetrium hanseni Nobili, 1906 has been rediscovered after more than eighty years and will be redescribed herein. It became obvious that all species involved in that report mainly have been found in more or less exposed locations near the reef slope, not a single specimen has been collected in sheltered places in the lagoons of fringing reefs.",

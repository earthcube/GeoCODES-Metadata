    "description": "A dedicated porbeagle shark survey using shark longline gear was conducted in 2007 and 2009 to provide an estimate of shark distribution and abundance. Longline gear was fished throughout the water column, from surface to bottom and back to surface. The survey area consisted of about 70 stations distributed in a grid pattern across the Scotian Shelf, in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and off of southern Newfoundland.",

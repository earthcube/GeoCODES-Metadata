    "description": "With the Great Barrier Reef our most important marine biodiversity resource, the Queensland Museum has a strong focus on marine invertebrates, including sessile, free-living and parasitic species. Much material has come from the CIDARIS Expeditions of the 1980s, the Great Barrier Reef Seabed Biodiversity Project 2003-2006 and more recent research-funded collecting along the eastern seaboard.\nThe Queensland Museum Other Invertebrates collection includes members from the following taxa: Eumetazoa, Acanthocephala, Annelida, Braciopoda, Bryozoa, Cnidaria, Ctenophora, Echinodermata, Hemichordata, Nematoda, Nemertea, Onychophora, Platyhelminthes, Sipuncula and Tunicata.\nThis dataset is of marine species sourced from the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) January 2019 (https://collections.ala.org.au/public/show/co201). Taxa have been matched to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) and if not then matched to the Australian Faunal Directory (AFD)",

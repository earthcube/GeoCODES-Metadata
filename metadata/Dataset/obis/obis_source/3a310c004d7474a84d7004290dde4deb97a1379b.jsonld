As part of sea turtle research we started satellite tracking on sea turtle to explore their critical offshore biological information needed to apply the conservation measures to save them. All sea turtle are endangered throughout the world including Bangladesh. Most of the offshore scientific information is unknown to us about this rare animal and each year thousands of sea turtles die due to bycatch in Bangladesh marine waters. Sea turtles are highly migratory and share international waters including many countries maritime territory that increases their chance of being caught by various type of fishing nets spread over the vast marine waters. Bangladesh is signatory of the regional and international conventions and treaties to save the endangered sea turtle. To save these global flagship species we need to uncover their migratory routes through which they come to breed and lay eggs in our long sandy beaches each winter, the coastal habitat they use during nesting season and pathways to long distance migrations at post nesting period. To understand this critical information we are going to set Satellite transmitters on olive ridley and green turtle following recognized scientific methods and protocols developed by pioneering sea turtle scientists throughout the world. This satellite tracking on sea turtle is first time in Bangladesh. This will reveal migratory routes of our sea turtle, depth they dive with temperature, nesting intervals and foraging habitat they use. This uncover will tremendously help in national sea turtle conservation efforts. The results will be used by large number of academics and students in the country and Government Department like Department of Forest, Department of Environment, Department of Fisheries, Bangladesh Coast Guard and Navy. We specially encourage your participation and cooperation to accomplish our efforts and fulfill the goal to save sea turtle in our marine waters.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=487\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

    "description": "We analyzed tissue δ13C, δ15N, and δ34S of animals associated with hydrocarbon seeps on the lower continental slope of the Gulf of Mexico. We made discrete collections of fauna associated with four dominant chemosymbiotic seep fauna: vestimentiferan tubeworms, bathymodiolin mussels, vesicomyid clams, and Sclerolinum sp. (another siboglinid worm related to vestimentiferans). These collections were conducted in 2006 and 2007 using the manned submersible Alvin and the remotely operated vehicle Jason II, both operated by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. The purpose of this study was to use stable isotopes to explore potential nutritional sources and trophic interactions in these seep communities, especially those occurring at over 1000 m depth, which had previously been poorly studied.",

Oceans Forward supports innovative science and local actions that have the potential to scale up and change the world. \n\n\nAbstract:\nDomSeTCO has been working in Dominica for many years teaching ocean and island conservation. Island ecosystems are fragile at best and with human intervention can become destabilized quickly. DomSeTCO has worked tirelessly for years conserving the sea turtles that make Dominica their home either permanently or temporarily. This project has dual purpose: first, to elucidate the habitats frequented by nesting leatherbacks in the waters of Dominica and their migratory routes for determining sites for high seas MPA's; Second, to be models in the classroom for the global nature of populations and how one small island can effect a global population.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=1209\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

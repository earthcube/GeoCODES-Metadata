    "description": "Acadia University, located in Wolfville, Nova Scotia is a source of biodiversity studies located in and around the Bay of Fundy. This resource was created as part of a data rescue project and contains species occurrence information described in a 4 part NRC summer job corps final report. This resource is part of a larger project investigating the ecology of the Bay of Fundy.\nThe first section in the report studied the macrophytic algae found along five transects in the vicinity of Black Rock, on the Minas Channel.  The zonation and percent biomass of the species were recorded.  The second section of the report is a continuation of a saltmarsh insect survey which started in 1977.  Samples helped determine distribution data and determined the number of Cicadellidae (hoppers) and Delphacidae (planthoppers) in the Wolfville saltmarsh area.  The final two sections describe studies of invertebrate populations found on the intertidal mudflats in the southern bight of the Minas Basin and Scot's Bay.  These studies were the first to examine biodiversity of the tidal flats in their respective areas. \nThis version of the resource contains the species distribution information associated with the algal study. For more information on the individual surveys see the source report, Gratto, 1978.",

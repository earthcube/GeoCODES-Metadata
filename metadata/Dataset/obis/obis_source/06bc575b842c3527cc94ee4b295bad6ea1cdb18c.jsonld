    "description": "This dataset contains occurrence records for specimens held by the Marine Collection, an aquatic natural history collection, at The University of the South Pacific in Suva, Fiji.\nA large component of records are from Fiji, however, there are records from different South Pacific island countries. Marine biodiversity collections and recording started in the late 1960s and continues to the present day. Freshwater records started in the 2000s and this database grows annually.\nRecords before the year 2000 do not have GPS coordinates, however, locality descriptions are provided. A future georeferencing project is planned to address this.\nData mobilisation is supported by the BID Pacific project \"Mobilizing biodiversity data from natural history collections in Fiji\" (BID-PA-2020-006-NAC), and the British Academy funded Youth Futures project \"(Re)Defining Culture: Engaging urban Fijian youth in sustainable employment opportunities in the cultural heritage sector (YF\\190078).\nThis dataset will be updated regularly.",

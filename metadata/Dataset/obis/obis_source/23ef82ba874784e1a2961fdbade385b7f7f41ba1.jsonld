    "description": "In November of 1969, the Canadian Government Research Vessel CSS 'Hudson' departed from the Bedford Institute of Oceanography in Dartmouth, NS to make a year long oceanographic cruise around the Americas. This was the Hudson70 expedition. Numerous biological studies were associated with this cruise and many were published. This resource contains species occurrence records of pelagic birds off the coast of Argentina as described in one such report (Cooke and Mills, 1972).",

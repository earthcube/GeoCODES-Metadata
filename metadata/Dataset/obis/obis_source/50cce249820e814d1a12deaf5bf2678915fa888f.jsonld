    "description": "This dataset is an output of the Pilbara Marine Conservation Partnership (PMCP) Environmental Pressures Theme - Project Habitats and Biodiversity Characterisation and Mapping. The benthic invertebrate, plant and fish biodiversity of the west Pilbara region was sampled between 10 and 27 June 2013 during voyages on the CSIRO vessel RV Linnaeus and WA Fisheries vessel RV Naturaliste. The equipment used was: 0.75m epibenthic sled at 13 sites for a distance of ~300m or a 1.5m epibenthic sled at 98 sites for a distance of ~150m per tow; a Pipe dredge attached to each sled; an 8 Fathom Florida Flyer Trawl at 43 sites for a distance of ~1km per tow; and a Drop-Camera video system towed for a 500 m transect at 123 sites to observe and record video of the seabed habitat.\nMetadata sourced from https://marlin.csiro.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/c935a434-168f-41bd-a83d-eeb4bdf4583f. Data from https://data.pawsey.org.au/ in the following path PMCP/Data_and_scripts/Environmental Pressures/habitat and biodiversity.",

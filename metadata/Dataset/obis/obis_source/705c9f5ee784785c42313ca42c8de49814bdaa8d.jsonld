    "description": "Original provider:\nProjeto Boto Cinza\n\nDataset credits:\nProjeto Boto Cinza\n\nAbstract:\nBetween August 2005 and July 2007, 376 Guiana dolphin (<i>Sotalia guianensis</i>) encounters were documented in Sepetiba Bay.\nFor the purpose of this study all dolphin sightings were classified as groups or aggregations. Groups (N = 268, x = 20, range =\n1–90) consisted of dolphins in apparent association usually engaged in the same behaviour and moving in the same direction.\nAggregations (N = 108, x = 204, range = 100–450) consisted of temporal association of numerous groups gathered in an\narea, totalling several hundred individuals usually engaged in the same behavior but not necessarily moving in the same\ndirection. Guiana dolphin groups and aggregations differed significantly in behavioral activity, spatial and temporal distribution\nand age composition. Most aggregated dolphins were engaged in foraging/feeding activities and primarily located at\nthe interior of the bay, and also, aggregations were more likely recorded during morning hours and had more neonates and\ncalves present when compared to groups. The plotted global positioning system (GPS) records of aggregations formed two distinct clusters of distribution\nwithin the bay, indicating potential areas where conservation strategies could be implemented.\n\nPurpose:\nThe objective of this study was to investigate the occurrence\nof Guiana dolphin aggregations regarding their seasonal,\ndiel and spatial distributions; behavioral activities, age\ncomposition and the environmental parameters measured\nduring their occurrence in Sepetiba Bay.",

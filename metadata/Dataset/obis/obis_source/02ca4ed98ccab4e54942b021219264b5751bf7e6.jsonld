    "description": "The study was conducted over 3 years (2012–2014) at Campbell Island/Motu Ihupuku (52°32′ S 169°8′ E), 644 km south of Aotearoa New Zealand. The most recent estimate (2009/10) of Campbell Island pup production was 681 pups, approximately 27% of the total species pup production (Maloney et al., 2009, 2012). In 2012 and 2013, juveniles and lactating adult female sea lions were captured manually at four different haul-out sites in Perseverance Harbour. The sea lions were equipped with satellite-linked SPLASH tags (Wildlife Computers), 138 × 38 × 20 mm, weight 145 g, which estimated locations using Argos satellites, and transmitted dive depth (±0.5 m) and duration (s). A total of 344 complete foraging trips were recorded with an average of 15.0 ± 8.5 trips per sea lion and lasting a mean of 115.5 ± 68.6 days in duration",

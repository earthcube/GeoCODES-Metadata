They are constantly impacted by a variety of both natural and anthropogenic factors.Satellite telemetry is a powerful tool for examining short- and long-term movements of these protected species and enhancing conservation and management efforts. These observations will allow us to examine how much time these turtles actually spend in the Mississippi Sound and what microhabitats they utilize. The use of satellite tags on recently rehabilitated and released sea turtles will increase our knowledge about the daily activities and habitat fidelity of these animals.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=1239\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

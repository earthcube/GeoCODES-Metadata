    "description": "Original provider:\nPhil Allman, Florida Gulf Coast University\n\nDataset credits:\nPhil Allman, Florida Gulf Coast University\n\nAbstract:\nMarine turtles have complex life cycles that include long-distance movements across coastal and pelagic habitats to access juvenile nurseries, foraging grounds, and eventually breeding grounds. Understanding these movement patterns is important for knowing habitat requirements and potential mortality risks for populations on a local, regional, and global scale. This knowledge is critically needed to inform resource managers and adopt best management practices for all populations. Although we are starting to understand the migration patterns for some species, there is a paucity of information regarding movement patterns of sea turtles that utilize nesting grounds in West Africa. We installed satellite tags on four female olive ridley sea turtles near the end of nesting season in Ghana. The purpose of this study was to determine their movement away from the nesting grounds. Two individuals remained in coastal waters within the Gulf of Guinea, whereas two individuals swam southerly and entered pelagic habitats of the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Even with the small sample size, these data suggest individuals disperse to different habitats near the end of nesting season.\n\nPurpose:\nThe purpose of this study was to describe the dispersal pattern of adult female olive ridley sea turtles at the end of nesting season in Ghana, West Africa.",

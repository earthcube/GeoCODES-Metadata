    "description": "Skin biopsies were obtained from sunfish caught as bycatch in the Australian Eastern Tuna and Billfish Fishery and New Zealand longline fisheries between February 2013 and February 2014, and between July 2013 and August 2014, respectively, by fisheries observers. Total length of each sunfish was recorded. There are additional occurrences recorded  from the Australian Western Tuna and Billfish Fishery - see cited paper and links to the occurrences.",

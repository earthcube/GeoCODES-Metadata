    "description": "This dataset summarises benthic surveys in Marra Sea Country, including the Limmen Marine Park (Commonwealth) and Limmen Bight Marine Park (Northern Territory). Records are from 3 datasets as described by the investigators are  (1) A point (site) shapefile describes (a) seagrass presence/absence, (b) seagrass species composition, (c) algae cover and (d) benthic macro-invertebrate cover at n=2018 sites surveyed by small vessel and helicopter. (2) A point (site) shapefile describes deep-water (a) seagrass presence/absence, (b) seagrass species composition, (c) algae cover and (d) benthic macro-invertebrate cover at 54 sites surveyed by benthic towed camera and sled net. (3) The meadow shapefile describes attributes of 69 seagrass meadows. Data sourced from cited paper on 2020-06-01.\nThe sampling methods used to study, describe and monitor seagrass meadows were developed by the TropWATER Seagrass Group and tailored to the location and habitat surveyed; these are described in detail in the relevant publications (https://research.jcu.edu.au/tropwater).",

    "description": "A study of the plankton in the Suez Canal could throw some light from the explanatory point of view,  on the distribution of the planktonic forms of the two different water bodies of  the Mediterranean and Red Sea. From the fisheries point of view, the plankton study is indispensable to seek out the relation between the abundance and movement of fishes and the fluctuations in the plankton; both in quantity and quality at different times, places and depths.",

    "description": "A hotspot of shipping and fisheries activity, Dutch Harbor and St Paul in western Alaska are susceptible to impacts of both climate change, which is projected to be greatest at high latitudes, and shipping related introductions of marine non-native species. The aims of this project were to establish measures of coastal ecosystem health that can be easily quantified and repeated, to inform recognition and understanding of ecosystem change in response to these forces.",

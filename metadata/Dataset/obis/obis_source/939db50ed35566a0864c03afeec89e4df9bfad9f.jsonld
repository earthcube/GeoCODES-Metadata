A European Union funding programme to develope management plans and protection for NATURA 2000 sites.\n\n\nAbstract:\nLittle is known of the foraging turtles in Amvrakikos Bay. We have tag returns from turtles that have nested at the three nearby Ionian nesting areas, Kefalonia, Zakynthos and Kyparissia Bay, but when they come and go and where they move around in the bay was unknown. This project has helped to answere some of these important conservation issues.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=5\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

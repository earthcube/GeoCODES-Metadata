    "description": "This dataset is based on the collection of data made at Campbell Island in the years 1944-47.\nFrom early 1941 to 1945, coast-watching stations were established at port Ross, Carnley Harbour (Auckland Islands), and Perseverance Harbour (Campbell Island) and the personnel of from three to five men each were relieved only once a year. These coast-watching stations to the New Zealand subantarctic islands was named the Cape Expedition. The objective was to warn of the possible use of Campbell and the Auckland Islands by German or Japanese warships. Standing instructions issued by Navy Office included a recommendation that the men should, in addition to service routine, record general observations on natural phenomena.\nElephant seals were found breeding on Campbell Island in 1941 when the island was first occupied by members of the Cape Expedition as a war-time security measure. The author studied the species in 1942, 1943, 1945, part of 1946, and in 1947.",

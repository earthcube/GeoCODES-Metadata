    "description": "This is the OBIS extraction of the Ocean Tracking Network  and Dalhousie University (DAL)  Apoqnmatulti'k - Bras D'Or Lake, consisting of the release tagging metadata, i.e. the location and date when the tagged animal was released, and summarized detection events of tagged individuals.\n    If readers are interested in the source dataset they may also inquire with the project PIs as listed here or on the OTN web site (https://members.oceantrack.org/project?ccode=BDLSPG).\nAbstract:Apoqnmatulti'k (Mi'kmaw for we help each other) is a multi-year collaborative research initiative that looks at the health and resilience of fish and other aquatic species in Mi'kma'ki. Guided by Etuaptmumk, or Two-Eyed Seeing, Apoqnmatulti'k pairs Mi'kmaw and local ways of knowing with western scientific methods to co-design and execute tracking programs to document the movements and habitat use of valued species in Pitu'pa'q (Bras d'Or Lake). Project partners include Mi'kmaw rights holders and technical advisors, local knowledge holders, commercial fishers, academia, and government. The project promotes the access, transfer and ownership of knowledge to these communities in support of their decision-making processes. The Bras d'Or Lake is one of two study sites covered under the project. The other is situated in Pekwitapa'qek (Bay of Fundy).",

    "description": "Original provider:\nHDR Environmental, Operations and Construction, Inc.\n\nDataset credits:\nThe U.S. Navy Marine Species Monitoring Program\n\nAbstract:\nAerial surveys for marine-species monitoring occurred during 22 through 28 June 2013 for a Small Synthetic Aperture Minehunter 2 (SSAM2) and Buried Object Scanning Sonar (BOSS) test event. These surveys were conducted off the west coast of Florida in the Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) Study Area in the Gulf of Mexico. The SSAM2 is a bottom-mapping and mine-hunting sonar developed for use in shallow-water and nearshore environments. The BOSS is a sonar system that images buried objects.\n\nPurpose:\nU.S. Navy protected marine species survey during SSAM2 and BOSS testing",

    "description": "The Discovery Investigations were a series of expeditions to the Southern Oceans funded out of proceeds from the sale of whaling licenses that took place between 1925 and 1951. The investigations had three main components: a marine laboratory at King Edward Point on South Georgia; the fast-sailing 326-ton RRS William Scoresby; and studies undertaken by the RSS Discovery. In 1929, the Discovery was replaced by the 1000-ton steel-hulled RRS Discovery II when the older ship was found to be simply too slow and cumbersome to carry out all the work required.\nA variety of sampling methods were deployed, including otter trawls, beam trawls, dredges, fish traps, and a variety of fine-meshed nets tow in the horizontal, vertical, or oblique.",

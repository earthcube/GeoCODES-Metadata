    "description": "This is the OBIS extraction of the OTN Shippagan, NB: Cod tagging project, consisting only of the release tagging metadata. i.e. the locations  and dates of tagged animal release. If readers are  interested in the full source  dataset they should refer to the OTN web site  (members.oceantrack.org). Abstract: The objectives of this project are first to study the seasonal migration of the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence and secondly to examine possible interaction between cod and grey seal (Halichoerus grypus). Cod were caught and tagged at Miscou Bank in the spring and lines of receivers were installed off Northwestern Cape Breton to intercept cod migrating out of the Gulf in the fall and back into the Gulf in the spring.",

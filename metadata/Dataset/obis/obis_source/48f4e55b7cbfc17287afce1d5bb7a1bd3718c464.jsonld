    "description": "A multidisciplinary survey was carried out in the Strait of Canso area during the summer of 1973 to determine the possible effects of industrialization of the area on the marine environment. This report is an illustrated catalogue of the Foraminifera and Ostracoda of the study. Samples were collected with benthic grabs and cores. Samples were sieved, stained in Rose Bengal, dried and weighted. After drying samples were transferred into samples of 10:4 Bromoform-Acetone in which less dense tests and shells were separated. The floating samples were dried and examined under microscope where the forams and ostracods were identified and counted. Plates showing images of the samples can be found in the original data report(Cole,1975). \n\n\nThis research was conducted by the Atlantic Geoscience Centre of the Geological Survey of Canada, department of energy, mines and resources.",

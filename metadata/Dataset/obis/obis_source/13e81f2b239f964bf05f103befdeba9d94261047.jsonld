    "description": "A monitoring program was initiated in May 1987 to study phytoplankton populations in the Western Isles region of the Bay of Fundy, southwest New Brunswick. Samples were collected for phytoplankton distribution and abundance. Water samples were collected at the surface using buckets from all locations and additional discrete depths of 10 m, 25 m, and 50 m were sampled using Niskin bottles at selected stations.\nNOTE:  Version 1 of this dataset prepared for OBIS contains only the surface distribution records for the period 1988-89.",

    "description": "Egg case nurseries of the boreal skate (Amblyraja hyperborea) and Richardson's skate (Bathyraja richardsoni) were defined and mapped on a bathyal seascape (c. 500–1900 m depths) of the Tasman Fracture and Huon Australian Marine Parks, south of Tasmania, Australia in 2018, using 99 towed-camera transects (157 linear km; N = 50,858 images). In total, 738 skate egg cases were observed (present in 240 images, absent in 50,618); among 113 egg cases examined to identify parent species, 70% were A. hyperborea, 10% B. richardsoni and 20% unidentified Bathyraja species. \nVoyage details (metadata, projects, other datasets either online or as downloads, publications and reports, events, maps etc) can be accessed at https://www.marine.csiro.au/data/trawler/survey_details.cfm?survey=IN2018_V06\nIf this data has been used in any products, please acknowledge with the following: We acknowledge the use of the CSIRO Marine National Facility (https://ror.org/01mae9353) in undertaking this research.\n\n",

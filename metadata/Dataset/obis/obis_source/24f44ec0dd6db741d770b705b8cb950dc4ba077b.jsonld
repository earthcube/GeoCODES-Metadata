    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nNOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC)\n\nAbstract:\nDuring 21 November 2017 – 04 January 2018, the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) conducted aerial abundance surveys targeting marine mammals and sea turtles. The southwestern extent was New Jersey and the northeastern extent was off of Nova Scotia, Canada in the Gulf of Maine. This survey covered waters from the coast line to about the 2000 m depth contour with a higher coverage over the New York State Offshore Planning Area. This survey coordinated with the southeast aerial survey that flew south of this study area in US waters. Track lines were flown 183 m (600 ft) above the water surface, at about 200 kph (110 knots). The two-independent team methodology was used to collect data. In Beaufort sea states of six and less, about 7,738 km of on-effort track lines were surveyed, where 93% of this effort was in Beaufort 3 and below.\n\nPurpose:\nThe objectives of this aerial flight was to collect the data needed to estimate abundance of cetaceans and turtles in the study area and to investigate how the animals’ distribution and abundance relate to their ecosystem.\n\nSupplemental information:\nThe survey code is TONE17WIN.\n\nPerpendicular distance to the animal is not publicly available.

    "description": "Ashmore Reef (123ºE 12ºS) is a small group of islets and reefs in the Timor Sea some 450 km north-east of the Kimberley, WA coast. Of the 21 species of shorebirds identified, five were found in internationally significant numbers. These were Grey-tailed Tattler, Ruddy Turnstone, Sanderling, Greater Sand Plover and Grey Plover. There were large breeding colonies of Sooty Terns on East and Middle Islands. Crested Terns were breeding in small numbers on East Island. Red-footed Boobies, Brown Boobies, and Lesser and Greater Frigatebirds were breeding on Middle Island.",

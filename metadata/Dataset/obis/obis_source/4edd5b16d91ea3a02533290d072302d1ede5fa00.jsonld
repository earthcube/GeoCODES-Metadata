    "description": "Plankton tows were carried out during two multidisciplinary oceanographic missions to the Sable Gully (Scotian Shelf, Canada) in 2006 and 2007. The first of these was onboard the CCGS Hudson (18HU06008) and took place between April 17, 2006 and May 7, 2006. The second was also on the CCGS Hudson (18HU07033) and took place between August 2, 2007 and August 9, 2007. Zooplankton were collected at a series of stations in the Gully by vertical tows using a 3/4m diameter ring net (202 micron mesh). Most tows were between 100m and the surface, with a few deeper casts. The OBIS collection is a subset of this dataset containing species distribution information.",

    "description": "This resource contains species distribution information associated with a study of ichthyoplankton communities in estuarine systems of Prince Edward Island (Johnston and Morse, 1987). As part of this study, fish eggs and/or larvae were collected during the summer of 1983 at eight stations in the Hillsborough River estuary - Northumberland Strait area and three stations in the Tracadie Bay - Gulf of St. Lawrence region.\nInformation on species occurrences recorded in this publication were digitized, standardized and republished as part of the Atlantic Coastal Zone Information Steering Committee (ACZISC) Atlantic Ecosystem Initiative (AEI) funded project “Atlantic Canada’s Biological Data for Ecosystem Planning and Decision-making” and OBIS Canada.",

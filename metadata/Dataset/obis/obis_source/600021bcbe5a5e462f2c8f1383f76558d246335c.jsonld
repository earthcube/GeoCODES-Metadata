    "description": "This data consists of counts of putative zooplankton OTUs, revealed through metabarcoding of the cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene extracted from filtered water samples in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary during 2016. It includes results from 95 water samples taken over three days at three coral reef sites. After data processing, a total of 194 taxa were identified; the identification was to the species level, with only a few to the genus level. ",

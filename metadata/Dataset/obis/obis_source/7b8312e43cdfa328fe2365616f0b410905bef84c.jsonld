    "description": "Seabird transects (n = 317) were conducted from the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) patrol vessel. The sampling was primarily designed to target focal sites that were typical pelagic habitats within the MPA, such as shallow seamounts (&lt;70 m), deep banks (ca. 400 m), deep seamounts (&lt;900 m), and deep basins (&lt;2,000 m). The survey ran from 2012 to 2016 between November and April, to overlap with the moderate phase of the monsoon. This period generally coincides with peak seabird breeding activity in the Chagos Archipelago.",

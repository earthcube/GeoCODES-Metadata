    "description": "Original provider:\nPaolo Luschi\n\nDataset credits:\nData provider\nIslameta Group, Dept. of Biology - University of Pisa\nOriginating data center\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/\">Satellite Tracking and Analysis Tool (STAT)</a>\nProject partner\nARCHE^ - Research and Educational Activities for Chelonian Conservation,  Ferrara, Italy.Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell Emilia-Romagna Bruno Ubertini - Ferrara Section.\n\n\nAbstract:\nThe aim of this project is to track a male loggerhead released from Porto Garibaldi, Northern Italy, in the Adriatic sea. The turtle (84 cm CCL; weight 59 kg) was found nearly dead in July 2002 in the same area, and was immediately named Bepi, a local nickname for Giuseppe (Joseph). The turtle had three large injuries on the carapace and a series of fractures of the hind legs. He has since recovered thanks to the efforts of vets of the local Experimental Zooprophylactic Institute and volunteers of a local organisation (ARCHE'). Bepi was deemed ready to be released in September 2003. On 24 Sept. a Telonics ST20 PTT was attached to his carapace with epoxy resin and fiberglass. Afterwards, the turtle was kept for a few days in an at-sea enclosure and released a few km offshore on 3 October.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=6\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

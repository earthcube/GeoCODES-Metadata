Facilities for rehabilitation are generously provided by Scuba Junkie Dive Resort on Mabul Island, which has a hatchery for safely rearing eggs and three tanks for holding the rehabilitating turtles. The Marine Research Foundation conducts research on the biology and ecology of sea turtles across many sites in the Indo Pacific region, and provides the equipment, along with technical and scientific input to this tracking project.\n\n\nAbstract:\nThis tracking project aims to determine the behaviour and movements of rehabilitated juvenile green sea turtles, which were brought to the Scuba Junkie rehabilitation center on Mabul Island, and cared for under the careful supervision by the Sabah Wildlife Department veterinarians.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=1276\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

    "description": "Original provider:\nThe Bio-Telemetry and Behavioral Ecology Lab at the Marine Mammal Institute, Oregon State University\n\nDataset credits:\nResearch was conducted under a collaboration with the National Science Foundation Office of Polar Programâ€™s Palmer Long-term Ecological Research Program and the Australian Antarctic division.\n\nAbstract:\nThis data is from 5 humpback whales that were tagged in the Western Antarctic Peninsula in 2012.  The tags were SPOT5 Platform Transmitting Terminals.  Tags were programmed to transmit between 00:00 and 04:00, and between 12:00 and 16:00 (GMT) daily, and were activated upon first dive after tagging.\n\nPurpose:\nThe purpose of this effort is to deepen the understanding of movement patterns and behaviors of humpback whales. This information is important to better understand the relationships between whales and their prey in an increasingly warming Western Antarctic Peninsula.\n\nSupplemental information:\nResearch was conducted under grant award ANT-0823101 and NMFS permit 14097, ACA permit 2009-013, and Duke University IACUC A049-112-02.",

    "description": "Over the past seventy years, diamondiferous deposits along the shoreline of southern Namibia have been targeted by coastal and beach mining operations.  As part of their mining licence agreement with the Government of Namibia, Namdeb Diamond Corporation Limited has commissioned a number of baseline and monitoring surveys over the past decade with the view to quantitatively assessing the direct and indirect effects of coastal and marine mining on intertidal and subtidal communities, and to monitor post-mining recovery.\n\nBakers Bay: Rocky shore data were collected from 3 impacted and 4 reference sites 1998, 2004 - 2012.  \n\nElizabeth Bay : Rocky shore (intertidal) data were collected from 5 impacted and 4 reference sites during 2004 - 2012.  Sandy beach data were collected from 5 impact and 2 reference sites in 2004, 2008, 2010 - 2012.  Shallow subtidal data were collected from 2 impacted and 4 reference sites during 2004 - 2007 and 2010 - 2012.  \n\nMining Area 1: Rocky shore data were collected from 5 sites, and sandy beach data were collected from 6 sites during  2007 - 2012.\n\nOffshore licenses: Benthic grab samples were collected from 6 areas between Luderitz and the Orange River mouth during 2001 - 2006, using a Van Veen grab.  Macrofauna was identified, and abundance and biomass determined.\n\nThe data were made available to AfrOBIS as a series of Excel sheets. At AfrOBIS, the data were quality-controlled and transformed to comply with the Darwin Core/OBIS Schema. Funds for data operations were kindly provided by the Census of Marine Life International Cosmos Prize Fund, through a grant to Rutgers University.",

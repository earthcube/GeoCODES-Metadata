    "description": "Original provider:\nThe Years of the North Atlantic Humpback whale\n\nDataset credits:\nPeter Stevick, University of Southern Maine\n\nAbstract:\nThe Years of the North Atlantic Humpback whale (YoNAH) is the broadest-ranging, most intensive study ever undertaken of a marine mammal species. Standardized sampling protocols were used in all areas to minimizes biases due to sampling. The YoNAH project collected photographs of individually distinctive natural markings, genetic samples and behaviour data on humpback whales in the North Atlantic Ocean. Field work began in January 1992 with a large-scale study of humpbacks in their principal West Indies breeding range at Silver Bank, Navidad Bank and Samana Bay, Dominican Republic; and Mona Passage, Puerto Rico. During summer, sampling was conducted in all the known major North Atlantic feeding grounds: the Gulf of Maine, Gulf of St. Lawrence, Newfoundland, Labrador, southwestern Greenland, Iceland, and Norway. In 1993 the same schedule of field work was repeated.\n\nPurpose:\nThe YoNAH project is a unique research program utilizing photo-identification techniques and molecular genetics to conduct an intensive survey of the population ecology of humpack whales throughout their known North Atlantic range. This internationally collaborative project involves scientists from seven nations. YoNAH's vast database supports a wide range of scientific investigations and also provides reliable, detailed information on which to base management policy. Archives of photographs, tissue samples and data will provide a valuable legacy for future research.\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2015-03-24] A sighting record at 1993-02-07 10:45:00 had a wrong animal count of zero. The value is replaced with a blank representing species presence only. The notes for this sighting mentions \"NO GROUP SIZE ESTIMATE\".\n\nA sighting record at 1992-08-04 15:00:00 had a wrong animal count of zero. The value is replaced with \"1\" that is an average of min and max counts, 0 and 2 respectively.\n\nData collection and analyses were conducted by reserach groups familiar with the study sites and with a history in use of these techniques for the study of humpback whale ecology. Allied Whale is responsible for photographic analysis and for database management. All the 5,500 photographs have been compared to one another to identify re-sightings. The accompanying databases are receiving final corrections and revisions. There are five datasets from YoNAH, including this one.\nBehavior of whales were recorded in some surveys.\nBiopsy samples and photographs were taken if possible.\nShips efforts and sightings of species other than humpback whales are recorded in the Effort dataset.\nThose datasets can be linked with LINKKEY field.\nFor those records having null starttime but non-null endtime, endtime was added to date the date/time of the observation.",

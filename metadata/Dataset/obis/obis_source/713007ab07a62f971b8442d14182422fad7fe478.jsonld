    "description": "At the time of this study, little was known about the aquatic vegetation of Kouchibouguac National Park, nor the Kouchibouguac River and its estuary.  As part of a university BSc honours project a floristic study was designed to study the composition of algal mats in the park.  Algal mats are assemblages of macrophyton, both detached and free-floating species, which have become entangled. The taxa found are listed in this dataset. Twelve different macrophytes were observed in the floating mats (8 were identified to species level).  Seventeen epiphytic diatoms were found and identified to the species or variety level.",

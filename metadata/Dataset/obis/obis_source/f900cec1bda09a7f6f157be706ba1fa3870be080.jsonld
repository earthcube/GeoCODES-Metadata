    "description": "Data from Swedish environmental monitoring of abundance of Harbour seal. Swedish monitoring of Harbour seals started in 1988. The monitoring program was initiated by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency and later the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management took over the responsibility and financing of the program. The monitoring is performed by the Swedish Museum of Natural History. Data is stored in the database SHARK, hosted and maintained by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute. Monitoring of seal is performed by counting seals from land, ship or airplane. More information is available in Swedish at https://www.havochvatten.se/hav/samordning--fakta/miljoovervakning/miljoovervakningens-programomrade-kust-och-hav/delprogram-sal-och-havsorn.html",

    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nKeith D. Mullin, NOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center\n\nAbstract:\nA Caribbean cetacean survey was conducted  in 1995 by NOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center to examine the distribution and estimate abundance of cetaceans in U.S. waters, especially in the Caribbean Sea and adjacent North Atlantic. This dataset contains sightings of not only cetaceans but also other species including sea turtles, fish and shark observed during the ship survey.\n\nDuring the 44 day cruise with 4,274 transect kilometers surveyed, nine cetaceans were identified, including\n\nHumpback whale\nMinke whale\nMesoplodon sp.\nZiphiidae\nPilot whale\nBottlenose dolphin\nAtlantic spotted dolphin\nPantropical spotted dolphin\nStriped dolphin\n\nThe dataset  is accompanied by transect data which is provided as a separate file.\n\nPurpose:\nThe purpose of this survey is to examine the distribution and estimate abundance of cetaceans in U.S. waters, especially in the Caribbean Sea and adjacent North Atlantic, which should meet the responsibility under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act.\nSpecific objectives of this survey are:\n\n1. Collect line transect data to estimate abundance and define the distributions of cetaceans in the northern Caribbean Sea and adjacent Atlantic Ocean.\n\n2.Collect ichthyoplankton samples in an Atlantic swordfish longline fishing area and throughout the survey area.\n\n3. Collect associated environmental data at designated stations.\n\n4. Obtain biopsy samples of skin and blubber from selected cetacean species in U.S. waters.\n\n5. Collect data on the distribution and abundance of seabirds and other marine life.\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2020-09-30] The following invalid species names were corrected according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS).\nBridled Tern: Sterna anaethetus (176897) =&gt; Onychoprion anaethetus (824104)\nLeast Tern: Sterna antillarum (176923) =&gt; Sternula antillarum (824127)\nSooty Tern: Sterna fuscata (176894) =&gt; Onychoprion fuscatus (824105)",

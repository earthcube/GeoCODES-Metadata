    "description": "The Socotra Archipelago, located in the eastern Gulf of Aden, has a unique marine environment which combines tropical and ‘pseudo-temperate’ elements. Studies on the fish biogeography of the archipelago, partially framed in regional studies, have substantially outpaced critical elementary research on the archipelago’s fish diversity. The present study seeks to close this gap and identifies the Socotra Archipelago as a major hotspot of coastal fish diversity in the Indian Ocean. The archipelago supports unique coastal fish assemblages which are predominantly composed of coral-associated (“reef”) species, in spite of the limited biogenic reef frameworks. A Preliminary Checklist comprises 682 species with confirmed records and a “Working List” includes an additional 51 records, totalling 733 faunal records in 108 families.",

    "description": "Original provider:\nUniversity of North Carolina, Wilmington\n\nDataset credits:\nWilliam A. McLellan, University of North Carolina Wilmington\n\nAbstract:\nOnslow Bay, off the coast of North Carolina, is currently the United States Navy's preferred site for an undersea warfare training range (USWTR). To determine the abundance and distribution of marine mammals and sea turtles within the USWTR, a monitoring program that includes aerial, vessel and passive acoustic survey techniques is currently being undertaken by Duke University, St. Andrews University and the University of North Carolina Wilmington. Surveys were flown in a Cessna 337, at 305 m altitude and 185 km/hr speed, with a pilot, co-pilot and two observers. The survey, consisting of ten 74 km long track-lines spaced 6.5 km apart, creating a 5 km boundary around the USWTR site, was flown 1 - 2 times a month.\n\nSupplemental information:\nThis dataset includes a subset of the data collection for the Onlsow Aerial surveys.\nOther data of the collection are available in the following datasets:\n<a href=\"http://seamap.env.duke.edu/dataset/751\">USWTR Onslow Bay Aerial Survey -Right side- 2010-2011</a>\n<a href=\"http://seamap.env.duke.edu/dataset/749\">USWTR Onslow Bay Aerial Survey -Left side- 2010-2011</a>\n<a href=\"http://seamap.env.duke.edu/dataset/586\">USWTR Onslow Bay Aerial Survey -Left side- 2008-2010</a>\n<a href=\"http://seamap.env.duke.edu/dataset/588\">USWTR Onslow Bay Aerial Survey -Right side- 2008-2010</a>\n<a href=\"http://seamap.env.duke.edu/dataset/435\">UNCW Aerial Surveys for monitoring of proposed Onslow Bay USWTR site - Left side -</a>\n\nAll the US Navy-funded survey datasets are found in the <a href=\"http://seamap.env.duke.edu/partner/NAVY\">OBIS-SEAMAP US Navy</a> page.",

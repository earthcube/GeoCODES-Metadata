    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nSoutheast Fisheries Science Center, NOAA\n\nAbstract:\nA spring marine mammals survey  in Gulf of Mexico was conducted  in 1992 by NOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center to examine the distribution and estimate abundance of cetaceans in U.S. waters. The survey was taken place along with Southeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program (SEAMAP) ichthyoplankton survey in coordination with Minerals Management Service. This dataset contains sightings of not only cetaceans but also other species including sea turtles, fish and shark observed during the ship survey.\n\nDuring the planned 54 survey days, 20 species were sighted, including\n\nAtlantic spotted dolphin\nBlainville’s beaked whale\nBryde’s whale\nClymene dolphin\nDwarf sperm whale\nDwarf/pygmy sperm whale\nFalse killer whale\nFraser’s dolphin\nKiller whale\nMelon-headed whale\nPantropical spotted dolphin\nPygmy killer whale\nRisso's dolphin\nRough-toothed dolphin\nShort/Long-finned pilot whale\nSperm whale\nSpinner dolphin\nStandard Bottlenose dolphin\nStriped dolphin\n\nThe dataset  is accompanied by transect data which is provided as a separate file.\n\nPurpose:\nThe purpose of this survey is to examine the distribution and estimate abundance of cetaceans in U.S. waters.\n\nSpecific objectives of this survey are:\n\n1. Conduct line transect surveys of marine mammals to study their diversity, distribution and abundance.\n\n2. Collect ichthyoplankton (particularly bluefin tuna eggs and larva) for distribution and abundance determinations.\n\n\n3. Collect associated environmental data in order to study the factors which may ultimately affect the diversity, distribution and abundance of both ichthyoplankton and marine mammals.\n\n4. Collect biopsy samples of marine mammals for genetic analysis in order to learn about the population structure of selected species.\n\n5. Collect flying fish (Exocoetidae) samples in order to study their diversity and distribution in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2020-09-30] The following invalid species names were corrected according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS).\nBridled Tern: Sterna anaethetus (176897) =&gt; Onychoprion anaethetus (824104)\nFranklin's Gull: Larus pipixcan (176838) =&gt; Leucophaeus pipixcan (824082)\nGull-billed Tern: Sterna nilotica (176926) =&gt; Gelochelidon nilotica (176882)\nLaughing Gull: Larus atricilla (176837) =&gt; Leucophaeus atricilla (824079)\nLeast Tern: Sterna antillarum (176923) =&gt; Sternula antillarum (824127)\nRoyal Tern: Sterna maxima (176922) =&gt; Thalasseus maximus (824142)\nSandwich Tern: Sterna sandvicensis (176927) =&gt; Thalasseus sandvicensis (176932)\nSooty Tern: Sterna fuscata (176894) =&gt; Onychoprion fuscatus (824105)",

    "description": "The South Australian Museum holds one of the most significant historical collections of Australian molluscs in the world. The collections of Marine Invertebrates are the most diverse and complex of any collections in the Museum, currently represented by 23 phyla. Although some of these phyla are relatively small in terms of species numbers, about half are large, diverse groups. It is estimated that the collection consists of over 1.5 million specimens and includes over 100000 specimen lots in spirit, a dry collection housed in 2700 drawers, some 1400 microscope slides, 2672 primary types, 9979 secondary types, some 35000 registered lots and a photo index collection of 4793 images.\nData downloaded from ALA (http://collections.ala.org.au/public/show/co165) and taxa have been matched to World Register of Marine Spscies.",

PhD student Julia Haywood has spent a year in the lab using forensics to find out which of the regular Alagadi nesting females may be using certain areas of interest as foraging sites. With a hit list of females in hand we set about tracking known females, but due to a relatively poor turnout of nesting females, not many of our target girls turned up. We therefore only managed to track 4 of our target of 11 females. Seven transmitters are ready to go out in 2018 when we hope to see more loggerhead nesting.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=1265\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

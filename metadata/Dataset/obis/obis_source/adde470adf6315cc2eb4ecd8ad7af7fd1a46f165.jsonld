    "description": "Phytoplankton and zooplankton samples were collected monthly along two cross shelf transects (CH-Line, B-Line) and one intermediate coastal station (SS) off Coffs Harbour (~30°S, 153°E), Eastern Australia, between May 2011 and September 2012. The exact sampling locations (coordinates) and times were recorded. Two of the sampling stations (CH3 and CH5) are also the sites of permanent IMOS moorings (CH070 and CH100, respectively).",

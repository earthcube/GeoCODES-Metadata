    "description": "Original provider:\nConor Ryan\n\nDataset credits:\nIWC\n\nAbstract:\nArchived logbooks detailing landings at Scottish shore-based whaling stations between 1903 and 1951 were used to map whale catch locations. \nHistorical distribution and occurrence are inferred and summary statistics on total landings are updated for blue (Balaenoptera musculus), fin (Balaenoptera physalus), humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae), North Atlantic right (Eubalaena glacialis), sei (Balaenoptera borealis) and sperm (Physeter macrocephalus) whales: a total of 9,996 whales were caught \nduring this period, which is 3.7% higher than previously reported and 25% higher for blue whales.\n\nSupplemental information:\nThis dataset contains a subset of the data used in the citation. The data \nbelong to IWC and the use of the data should be credited to the references.",

    "description": "Queensland has the highest diversity of marine and terrestrial crustaceans in Australia, largely due to the rich diversity of habitats in these tropical and subtropical climates.\n\nCrustacean collection strengths include:\n\n- holdings of almost all Australian decapod species (crabs, shrimps, lobsters and their relatives);\n\n- one of the most comprehensive collections of Indo-West Pacific mangrove and shore crabs in the world;\n\n- significant holdings of isopods;\n\n- approximately 17,000 specimens from Great Barrier Reef Seabed Biodiversity Project 2003-2006.\nData downloaded from ALA (http://collections.ala.org.au/public/show/co135). Taxa matched to World Register of Marine Species",

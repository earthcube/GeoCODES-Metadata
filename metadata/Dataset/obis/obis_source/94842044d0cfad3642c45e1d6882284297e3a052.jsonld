The objective of this project is to use satellite telemetry to study and analyze the at-sea movements of female turtles, both during and following the nesting season, for the most threatened species that occur along the Brazilian coast (Caretta caretta, Dermochelys coriacea, Eretmochelys imbricata and Lepdochelys olivacea). The project will involve the deployment of 40 satellite tags: 15 on hawksbill turtles, 5 on leatherback turtles, 10 on loggerhead turtles and 10 on olive ridley turtles. The project officially began on February 02nd, 2005 when 15 satellite tags (KiwiSat 101 from Sirtrack Limited) were attached to the carapaces of hawksbill turtles that had just finished nesting on beaches along the northern coast of Bahia, Brazil. In continuity to this Study, 03 transmitters KiwiSat 101(with capacity to work for up to 450 days) were installed in females of the species Dermochelys coriacea (leatherback sea turtle) in Espirito Santo, only reproductive area of this species in the Brazilian coast. The last species that received  transmitters was the Caretta caretta (loggerhead sea turtle), in the coast of Bahia, and Lepidochelys olivacea (olive ridley sea turtle), in the north coast of Sergipe, in the  February of 2006.

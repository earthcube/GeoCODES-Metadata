    "description": "The current dataset includes information of the Polychaeta (Annelida) species recorded in coastal waters and the EEZ of the the Republic of Cyprus that were recorded between 1972 and 2022. Data come from a total of 31 bibliographic references (published articles and conference papers) and  44 new surveys. From the new surveys, the 30 were carried out as part of the annual implementation of environmental monitoring surveys of the open-sea aquaculture units that have to be implemented as part of the National Aquaculture Legislations, 7 surveys were Research funded Projects, 4 were Baseline Survey Assessments as part of the implementation of Environmental Impact Assessments, 2 were multiannual surveys that were carried out as part of the WFD and the MSFD and 1 was related to the Fisheries Data Collection Programme that are implemented in the Republic of Cyprus. The dataset includes 8043 records of polychaeta presence. For each record, when present, information are included on the taxonomy (NIS, Questionable species, Cryptic species), location (region, village/city, station), depth, habitat category, sediment type, TOM, TOC, association with flora (macroalgae/seagrasses) and human activities, on the project, the taxonomists/institution and any additional comments.The polychaetes were classified into 49 families and 584 polychaete species. A total of 204 species (54%) were recorded based on literature only, 149 (26%) were newly recorded based on own data, while a total of 231 spp. (40%) were recorded from both literature and new data. A total of 50 polychaete species were identified as non-indigenous; among them, 31 are confirmed as alien species, 4 are considered cryptogenic, and 15 are considered questionable as there are doubts about their identity.

    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nNOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC)\n\nAbstract:\nAs part of the Gulf of Mexico Marine Assessment Program for Protected Species (GoMMAPPS), the SEFSC conducted shipboard surveys of the oceanic waters of the Gulf out to the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) between 14 January and 16 March 2018. The survey was designed for a two independent visual observer teams approach with Distance sampling to estimate the detection probabilities for marine mammal sightings; however, the survey was conducted with only one team between 14 January and 5 February.\n\nPurpose:\nThe primary goal was to collect data on the distribution and abundance of marine mammals in the U.S. waters of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) using visual survey teams and passive acoustic monitoring.\n\nSupplemental information:\nProvider's survey code is GU1801.\nPerpendicular distance to the animal is not publicly available.\nThe dataset is accompanied by transect (effort) data which is provided as a separate file.\n\nSightings included were detected by the flying bridge only or by both the flying bridge and bridge wing teams.\n\nEnvironmental Attribute Codes\nBeaufort Sea state\n0 Calm, mirror like seas\n1 Waves &lt;1ft, rippled surface\n2 Small wavelets (&lt;2 ft), no white caps\n3 Large wavelets (&lt;3ft), scattered white caps\n4 Swell 3-4 ft, numerous white caps\n5 Swell &gt;5 ft, many white caps, some spray\n6 Swell &gt;10 ft, white caps everywhere, spray\nVisibility\n0 Clear\n1 Good\n2 Fair\n3 Poor\nWeather\n0 Clear\n1 Mist\n2 Light Rain\n3 Heavy Rain\nCloud Cover\n0 Clear\n1 0-25% Cloudy\n2 26-50% Cloudy\n3 51-75% Cloudy\n4 76-100% Cloudy\n5 Overcast\nGlare\n0 No Glare\n1 &lt;10% of visual field\n2 10-25% of visual field\n3 26-50% of visual field\n4 51-75% of visual field\n5 &gt;75% of visual field\nGlare intensity\n0 No Impairment\n1 Slight Impairment\n2 Moderate Impairment\n3 Severe Impairment\nConditions\n0 Poor\n1 Fair\n2 Moderate\n3 Good\n4 Excellent",

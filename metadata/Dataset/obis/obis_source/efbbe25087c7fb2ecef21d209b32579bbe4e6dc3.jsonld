    "description": "The body surface, mouth, gills, internal organs and tissues of 368 teleost fish of 26 species from Prydz Bay, Heard Island, Macquarie Island, Davis Station and Casey Station in Antarctica were examined for parasites.  At least eight species of Monogenea, seven species of Copepoda, and five or six species of Acanthocephala were recorded.  Overall, the fauna of Monogenea and Copepoda of Antarctic fish is much poorer than that of lower latitudes, and there are fewer species of Gyrodactylidae relative to other Monogenea than at higher northern latitudes.  Abundance and species richness of Acanthocephala are relatively high.\nQuality: Values provided in temporal coverage are approximate only.\n\nNote from the AADC, 2018-08-02:\n\nThe original datasheet was reformatted to fit IPT Biodiversity.AQ standard. The new datasheet \"AntarticFishParasites.csv\" provides the dataset ID, event date, decimal latitude, decimal longitude, continent, country, occurrence, basis of record, protocol and preparation. The organism quantity of parasites identified from host. The lowest taxonomical rank of the species identified that could be determined is provided, after matched in WoRMS (World Register of Marine Species). It also contains the associated taxa, which is as a list of names of taxa and their associations with the occurrence (Host: species), and the associated reference.",

    "description": "Lord Howe Island (31° 33’S, 159° 04’E) sits approximately 580 km east of the eastern coast of Australia. The main focus of the survey was the shallow shelf surrounding Lord Howe Island, which ranges in depth from 25 to 150 m. For each sample station, a Smith-McIntyre bottom sediment sampler (10 litre, 0.1 m2 gape) was operated from the starboard deck of Southern Surveyor. The grab was used to collect sediment and infauna samples. It uses a spring-loaded scoop triggered by contact with the seabed and can collect an intact sample of sediment. Upon triggering, the\ngrab immediately covers the sample, which prevents disturbance during retrieval to the surface. In some locations, three replicate samples were taken.\nMetadata record at https://ecat.ga.gov.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/72010 Survey report  GA2461_Record 2010_026_Lord Howe Island.pdf at http://dapds00.nci.org.au/thredds/catalog/fk1/Post-survey_reports/catalog.html",

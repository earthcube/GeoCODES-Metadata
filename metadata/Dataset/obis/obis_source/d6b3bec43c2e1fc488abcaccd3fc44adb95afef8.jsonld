ZSL runs ZSL London Zoo and ZSL Whipsnade Zoo, carries out scientific research in the Institute of Zoology, and our Conservation Programmes department is actively involved in field conservation in over 30 countries worldwide including the UK.  The two zoos receive over 1.3 million visitors a year and are supported by some 250 volunteers working across the two sites.  A registered charity (No. 208728), ZSL is dedicated to achieving and promoting the worldwide conservation of animals and their habitats in the context of communities.  ZSL's conservation work aims to build capacity and influence policy, to bring direct and sustainable conservation benefits to wild animals and their habitats, with activities typically undertaken by forming partnerships with local organisations and government departments.\nProject sponsor or sponsor description\nWe would like to thank M. Langdon, M.Andersson, R.Atterburys, W. Van Aalst for their support.The epoxy for the satellite tags has been generously donated by Powers Europe.\n\n\nAbstract:\nMaluane is an innovative community-based conservation programme ensuring the protection of the exceptional coastal biodiversity in the northern Querimbas Archipelago on Vamizi and Rongui islands, using eco-tourism as an economic engine.In partnership with the Zoological Society of London, Maluane has built on local knowledge to develop a team of monitors from the village who have successfully protected and monitored more than 700 nests of green and hawksbill turtles over the last 5 years. The area harbours some of the most pristine coral reefs in the world and seagrass habitats which are also used as developmental grounds by turtles. The project draws on the expertise and guidance of the Marine Turtle Research Group.The satellite tagging of turtles will enable the identification of functional units of management  in this part of the Western Indian Ocean which is recognised as being of global conservation value, and where turtles have never been studied before. The project is extremely grateful to Seaturtle.org for their assistance in the production of the map to track turtle's movements.Related links <a href=\"http://www.zsl.org/turtletracking\">www.zsl.org/turtletracking</a> <a href=\"http://www.maluane.com\">www.maluane.com</a>\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=204\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

    "description": "This is the OBIS extraction of the Ocean Tracking Network  and Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO)  Shippagan, NB: Cod tagging, consisting of the release tagging metadata, i.e. the location and date when the tagged animal was released, and summarized detection events of tagged individuals.\n    If readers are interested in the source dataset they may also inquire with the project PIs as listed here or on the OTN web site (https://members.oceantrack.org/project?ccode=SPI).\nAbstract:The objectives of this project are first to study the seasonal migration of the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence and secondly to examine possible interaction between cod and grey seal (Halichoerus grypus). Cod were caught and tagged at Miscou Bank in the spring and lines of receivers were installed off Northwestern Cape Breton to intercept cod migrating out of the Gulf in the fall and back into the Gulf in the spring.",

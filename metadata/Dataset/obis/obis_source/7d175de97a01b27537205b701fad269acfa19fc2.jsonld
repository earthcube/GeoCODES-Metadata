    "description": "The Herpetology Collection comprises more than 76,000 specimens of snakes, lizards, frogs, salamanders, tortoises and turtles.\n\nEstablished in the 1850s, the majority of the collection comprises specimens kept in 70% alcohol, plus sub-collections of ethanol-fixed and frozen tissues, a dry and skeletal collection, an X-ray and photographic collection.\nThis dataset is of marine species sourced from the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) January 2019 (https://collections.ala.org.au/public/show/co117). Taxa have been matched to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) and if not then matched to the Australian Faunal Directory (AFD)",

    "description": "Original provider:\nIsrael National Nature and Parks Authority - Sea Turtle Rescue Center\n\nDataset credits:\nData provider\nIsreal's Sea Turtle Monitoring Program\nOriginating data center\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/\">Satellite Tracking and Analysis Tool (STAT)</a>\n\n\nAbstract:\nThe Israeli Nature and Parks Authority (NPA)operates this turtle monitoring program, sponsored by the NPA together with Israel Electric Company,  to track rehabilitated sea turtles – mainly Loggerheads (Carreta carreta) and Green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas). Tracked turtles were released to sea after spending several months at the Israel Sea Turtle Rescue Center, to which they arrive suffering from various injuries. The purpose of this current monitoring program is to learn about these turtles' habits and behavior – post rehabilitation, to get a better understanding on their rehabilitation needs.Previous monitoring programs focused on nesting females as well as Green turtles released after being kept in captivity as part of a breeding stock project, aimed to help increase the number of hatchlings in the wild. Tracking healthy turtles at sea allows the identification of feeding zones and migration paths, information of paramount importance for the protection of these endangered species.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=1003\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

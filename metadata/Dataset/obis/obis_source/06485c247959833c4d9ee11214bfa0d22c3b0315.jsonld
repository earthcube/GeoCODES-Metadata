    "description": "Oceanographic surveys were conducted in the lower Bay of Fundy and Roseway Basin during the summers of 1999, 2000 and 2001. Zooplankton sampling was conducted in all years from NOAA Ship ‘Delaware II’ and additional sampling was conducted from NOAA Ship ‘Albatross IV’ in 2001. Zooplankton samples were obtained both in the presence (within a few hundred meters) and absence of right whales.",

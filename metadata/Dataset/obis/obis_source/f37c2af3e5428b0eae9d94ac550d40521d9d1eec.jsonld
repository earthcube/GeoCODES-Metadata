    "description": "Collection of historical Marine Ecology Laboratory datasets of macrofauna species distribution from sampling sites in the intertidal zone at locations in and around the Bay of Fundy between the period 1977-1979.\nNOTE- this initial version of the resource contains only distribution information collected on May 12, 1977.\n\nNumbers of macrofauna were determined in sediments from various stations along an intertidal transect by sampling during low tide. Samples were taken by either shovel or grab to approximately 10 cm depth (determined by where hard compact sediment was encountered) at various stations.",

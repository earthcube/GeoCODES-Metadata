    "description": "Original provider:\nNicolas Pilcher, Marine Research Foundation &amp; Marina Antonopoulou, Emirates Nature WWF\n\nDataset credits:\nNicolas Pilcher, Marine Research Foundation\n\nAbstract:\nMarine turtles are integral components of the Arabian region marine ecosystems, and a priority conservation component of national and regional conservation programmes. Sea turtles are protected in all countries bordering the Arabian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, and are a priority species in Emirates Nature-WWF's Strategy 2015-2020, as well as WWF’s Global Marine Turtle Strategy 2012-2020 (WWF, 2012).\n\nTurtles are in danger from accidental bycatch of juveniles and adults in fishing operations, marine habitat alteration and degradation, exploitation of eggs, loss of nesting beaches, and potentially through rising temperatures with climate change. Younger turtles are also impacted by cold-stunning events during winter months.\n\nA small number of protected areas exist which encompass certain life stages of sea turtles in the Gulf region, but these are spatially-limited given the state of knowledge on turtle habitat use - we have little information on where green turtles migrate to following nesting areas, and where key foraging and development grounds are found.\n\nThe Gulf Green Turtle Project will allow us to decipher the migration paths of green sea turtles, as these comprise the most abundant turtle species in the inner Gulf region and the second most abundant in Oman, and will identify linkages between foraging and nesting populations within the important Gulf biogeographic region, allowing us to guide conservation actions and raise awareness of the importance of marine turtle populations.\n\nData resulting from this work will inform managers of critical in–water habitats utilised by Arabian turtles, and allow them to aim concerted conservation activities, including fishery regulation where applicable, to preserve turtles through all phases of their live cycle.\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2023-01-27] Additional 48 tags were appended.\n\nThis project is implemented by Emirates Nature - WWF, formerly known as Emirates Wildlife Society-WWF, with scientific advice from the Marine Research Foundation (MRF).\n\nThe data is also available at the STAT web site (http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/?project_id=1199) but this version is different as the data shared with OBIS-SEAMAP was filtered by the provider.",

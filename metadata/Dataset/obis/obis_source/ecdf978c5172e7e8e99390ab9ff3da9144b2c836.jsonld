    "description": "Original provider:\nAPEM Inc.\n\nDataset credits:\nAPEM Inc. and Normandeau Associates Inc.\n\nAbstract:\nEquinor Wind US, LLC were committed to undertaking a Construction and Operation Plan (COP) of Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) Lease Area Outer Continental Shelf (OCS-A) 0520, now called Beacon Wind. To facilitate this, 12 surveys were undertaken by APEM Inc. and Normandeau Associates, Inc. (Normandeau-APEM Team) between March 2021 and October 2021 to provide baseline information for consideration in the assessment of potential impacts. Additional surveys were collected between December 2019 and November 2020 and can be accessed .\n\nPurpose:\nEquinor initiated monthly offshore high resolution aerial surveys of marine mega-fauna in the Massachusetts Lease Area plus a 4 km (2.5 mile) buffer. The surveys used APEM Inc.'s ultra-high resolution aerial digital still imagery. The aims and objectives of the work are to assess the abundance and distribution of birds, marine mammals, sharks, rays, and turtles \npresent in the Lease Area OCS-A 0520 over the course of the spring to fall period. The surveys will provide the baseline information required for conducting impact assessments and are consistent with the survey guidelines for providing avian, marine mammal, and sea turtle information for renewable energy development on the OCS (BOEM 2017 and 2019). The \ndataset is comprised of observations and survey track line information collected from March 2021 to October 2021 (12 surveys in total)  APEM analyzed the images to enumerate birds to species level, and to enumerate any other non-avian marine fauna. Normandeau \nprovided quality assurance (QA) of the data.\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2022-06-06] The following recorded species names got their assigned scientific names corrected.\nBILLFISH SPECIES: Alcidae =&gt; Istiophoridae\nLARGE GULL SPECIES: Leucophaeus atricilla =&gt; Ciconiiformes\nSEAL SPECIES: Otariidae =&gt; Caniformia\nSANDBAR SHARK: Calidris alba =&gt; Carcharhinus plumbeus",

    "description": "The biomass and species composition of tropical zooplankton in Albatross Bay, Gulf of Carpentaria, northern Australia, were examined monthly for three years between March 1986 and March 1988. Zooplankton taxonomic groups were identified to species level where possible, with a primary focus on copepods. Data is stored as mean number of individuals per site. Sampling occurred across 5 sites (Site 1 = Inshore, Site 5 = Offshore, Sites progressed westward). Temperature and salinity were also recorded for many samples.",

    "description": "Original provider:\nPaolo Luschi, University of Pisa\n\nDataset credits:\nPaolo Luschi, University of Pisa\n\nAbstract:\nFive females of <i>Chelonia mydas</i> were tracked by satellite in the South China Sea in 1993 and 1994. Four of them reached their feeding grounds 600-1551 km distant. Part of the journeys occurred coastwise, indicating that leading geographical features had been\nutilized. The straightness of the turtles' tracks in open seas, both over shallow and deep waters, and their ability to pinpoint distant targets provides circumstantial evidence for a true navigation mechanism.",

    "description": "Original provider:\nSea Mammal Research Unit, University of St. Andrews\n\nDataset credits:\nSea Mammal Research Unit, University of St. Andrews\n\nAbstract:\nThe Cetacean Offshore Distribution and Abundance in the European Atlantic (CODA) project estimated the abundance and investigated the habitat use of cetacean species in waters beyond the continental shelf and developed a management framework for determining safe bycatch limits for the common dolphin in this area. The results were intended primarily to inform assessments of the conservation status of all cetacean species and to help assess the impact of bycatch of common dolphin.\n\nSupplemental information:\nSurveys from seven different vessels were merged. Each vessel contained two sightings platforms running concurrently â€“ primary and tracker. This dataset includes sightings from the tracker platform. Sightings from the primary platform are registered in <a href=\"/dataset/1180\">CODA cetacean sightings on primary platform of vessel surveys 2007</a>.\nEffort (vessel tracks) is associated with the primary platform dataset.",

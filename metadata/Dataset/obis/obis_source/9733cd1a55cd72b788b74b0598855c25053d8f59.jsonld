    "description": "The BANZARE Expeditions (British, Australian, New Zealand, Antarctic Research Expeditions) 1929 - 1931 sampled the marine benthos in the Southern Ocean, at the Kerguelen Islands, Heard Island, Macquarie Island, and southwest of Tasmania and along the coast of the Australian Antarctic Territory. Forty six stations at depths of 2 - 640 m were occupied along the Australian Antarctic Territory coast. Eight species of Halecium including five new and Hydrodendron arboreum were found and recorded from eight stations.",

    "description": "The published report on the Dominion of Canada Government expedition to the Arctic Islands and Hudson Strait on board the D.G.S. Arctic (1908-1909) contains a list of birds and other fauna observed during the voyage. The report also contains a list of flora collected during their winter stay at Winter Harbour.\nInformation was extracted from the report and occurrence records created - this required that latitude and longitude positions be assigned to the location place names recorded in the original tables.\nAdditional information recorded by the naturalists is included in these records as occurrence remarks, however, this dataset does not include abundance information.",

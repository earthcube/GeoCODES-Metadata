    "description": "The diversification of the teleost suborder Notothenioidei (Perciformes) in Antarctic\nwaters provides one of the most striking examples of a marine adaptive radiation. Along\nwith a number of adaptations to the cold environment, such as the evolution of antifreeze\nglycoproteins, notothenioids diversified into eight families and at least 130 species. Here,\nwe investigate the genetic population structure of the humped rockcod (Gobionotothen\ngibberifrons), a benthic notothenioid fish. Six populations were sampled at different\nlocations around the Scotia Sea, comprising a large part of the species’ distribution range\n(N = 165). Our analyses based on mitochondrial DNA sequence data (352 bp) and eight\nmicrosatellite markers reveal a lack of genetic structuring over large geographic distances\n(¦ST £ 0.058, FST £ 0.005, P values nonsignificant). In order to test whether this was due to\npassive larval dispersal, we used GPS-tracked drifter trajectories, which approximate\nmovement of passive surface particles with ocean currents. The drifter data indicate that the\nAntarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) connects the sampling locations in one direction only\n(west–east), and that passive transport is possible within the 4-month larval period of\nG. gibberifrons. Indeed, when applying the isolation-with-migration model in IMA, strong\nunidirectional west-east migration rates are detected in the humped rockcod. This leads us\nto conclude that, in G. gibberifrons, genetic differentiation is prevented by gene flow via\nlarval dispersal with the ACC.\nKeywords: adaptive radiation, population genetics, isolation-with-migration model, drifters",

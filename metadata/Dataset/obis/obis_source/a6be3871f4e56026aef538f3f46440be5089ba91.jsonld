    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nHubard, C. W. &amp; Mullin, K. D., NOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center\n\nAbstract:\nA spring cetacean survey in the northern U.S. Gulf of Mexico was conducted  in 2000 by NOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center and Minerals Management Service to examine cetacean abundances in both oceanic and continental shelf waters. \nThis survey was conducted in coordination with the spring Southeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program (SEAMAP) ichthyoplankton survey.\n\nThe dataset contains sightings of not only cetaceans but also other species including sea turtles, fish and shark observed during the ship survey.\n\nDuring the 35 survey days, at least 19 species were sighted, including\n\nBryde's whale\nSperm whale\npygmy sperm whale\nDwarf sperm whale\nCuvier's beaked whale\nStriped dolphin\nSpinner dolphin\nClymene dolphin\nPantropical spotted dolphin\nAtlantic spotted dolphin\nBottlenose dolphin\nRough-toothed dolphin\nFraser's dolphin\nRisso's dolphin\nFalse killer whale\nPilot whale\nPygmy killer whale\nMelon-headed whale\n\nThe dataset  is accompanied by transect data which is provided as a separate file.\n\nPurpose:\nThe purpose of this survey is to examine the distribution and estimate abundance of cetaceans in U.S. waters.\n\nSpecific objectives of this survey are:\n\n1. Collect ichthyoplankton samples for estimates of the abundance and distribution of Atlantic bluefin tuna larvae.\n\n2. Collect data to estimate the abundance and distribution of cetaceans in the oceanic northern Gulf of Mexico.\n\n3. collect associated environmental data at all designated ichthyoplankton stations.\n\n4. Collect data on the distribution of sea turtles, seabirds and other marine life.\n\n5. Obtain biopsy samples of skin and blubber from selected cetacean species for genetic stock structure and contaminant analyses.\n\n6. Obtain photographs of selected cetacean species for photo-identification studies.\n\n7. Collect data on distribution and type of marine debris encountered during the survey.\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2020-09-30] The following invalid species names were corrected according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS).\nBridled Tern: Sterna anaethetus (176897) =&gt; Onychoprion anaethetus (824104)\nCaspian Tern: Sterna caspia (176924) =&gt; Hydroprogne caspia (176935)\nGull-billed Tern: Sterna nilotica (176926) =&gt; Gelochelidon nilotica (176882)\nLaughing Gull: Larus atricilla (176837) =&gt; Leucophaeus atricilla (824079)\nRoyal Tern: Sterna maxima (176922) =&gt; Thalasseus maximus (824142)\nSooty Tern: Sterna fuscata (176894) =&gt; Onychoprion fuscatus (824105)",

    "description": "The database covers the Haida Gwaii archipelago, including the contiguous waters of Dixon Entrance, Hecate Strait, Queen Charlotte Sound and westward into the Northeast Pacific to 145 degrees W (based on research cruise reports). Records from Vancouver Island, the mainland (continental) British Columbia and Alaska coasts, mainland coast islands and inlets were excluded. It includes all species of the Haida Gwaii region from any published source, accessible collection and unpublished observations from scientists. Subspecies are included in the database. Includes all marine invertebrate species recorded from the intertidal to the deep-sea and maps their distributions known to the end of 2000. The GIS contains 25,000 invertebrate records of &gt;2,500 species from 2,900 localities.",

We tagged five loggerhead sea turtles that were collected from North Carolina nests and raised in captivity, at the Pine Knoll Shores Aquarium. The turtles were tagged with solar-powered satellite transmitters (Microwave Telemetry) at the Roanoke Island Aquarium under the guidance of Dr. Kate Mansfield, who did a study upon which ours was based (Mansfield et al. 2014). The tagged turtles were released in Sargassum mats in the Gulf Stream off the coast of North Carolina.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=1272\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

    "description": "The dataset is a compilation of records of sea turtles caught in prawn trawls in the Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF). There are 316 records of five species. The records are from research voyages, scientific observers on commercial prawn trawlers and crew member observers on commercial prawn trawlers. More specifically, the data sources were as follows: (a) CSIRO and collaborative research voyages on RV Southern Surveyor; (b) crew member observers on NPF commercial vessels, 2003-2005 (FRDC project 2002/035, collaboration between CSIRO and AFMA, funding by FRDC); (c) scientific observers on NPF commercial vessels (FRDC project 2000/173, collaboration between CSIRO and the Australian Maritime College (AMC), funding by FRDC); (d) crew members and scientific observers on NPF commercial vessels (FRDC project 1998/202, collaboration between BRS, CSIRO, AFMA, funding by FRDC and NORMAC); (e) crew member observers and scientific observers on NPF commercial vessels and RV Southern Surveyor (FRDC project 1996/257, collaboration between CSIRO, DPIQ and AMC, funding by FRDC).\nMetadata at http://www.marlin.csiro.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/search#!010aebb9-8444-4fda-9302-b59594b6df52",

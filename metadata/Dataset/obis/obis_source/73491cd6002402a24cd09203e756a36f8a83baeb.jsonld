    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nNOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC)\n\nAbstract:\nAs part of the AMAPPS program, the Southeast Fisheries \nScience Center conducts aerial surveys of continental \nshelf waters along the US East Coast from Southeastern \nFlorida to Cape May, New Jersey. Aerial survey TOSE14SPR \nwas conducted during 2014 between 24 March and 28 April. \nThe survey was conducted along tracklines oriented \nperpendicular to the shoreline that were latitudinally \nspaced 20 km apart aboard a NOAA Twin Otter aircraft at \nan altitude of 600 feet (183 m) and a speed of 110 knots. \nThe survey was designed for analysis using Distance \nsampling and a two-team (independent observer) approach \nto correct for visibility bias in resulting abundance \nestimates. The survey covered waters from Cape May, NJ to \nSouth Carolina including “fine-scale” tracklines in \nwaters offshore of New Jersey and Virginia. Due to \nweather conditions during the survey, only effort from \nSouth Carolina to Cape May, New Jersey was completed.\n\nPurpose:\nThe goal of the survey was to conduct line-transect surveys \nusing the Distance sampling approach to estimate the \nabundance and spatial distribution of marine mammals and \nturtles in waters over the continental shelf (shoreline to \n200m isobaths) from Southeast, Florida to Cape May, New \nJersey.\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2019-04-15] Data were updated for the correction in the \nglare column.\n\nTrip ID / Dataset ID of this dataset is TOSE14SPR.\n\nPerpendicular distance to the animal is not publicly \navailable.\nTurtle and marine mammal data were submitted separately \nbut merged into one dataset.\nThe dataset is accompanied by transect (effort) data \nwhich is provided as a separate file.\nData were further audited in 2018 since publication of \nAnnual Report in 2014.\nSightings included were detected on-effort by the forward \nteam only; you may request the full dataset and sightings \nincluding opportunistic ones directly to the provider.\n\nEnvironmental Attribute Codes\nBeaufort Sea state\n0 Calm, mirror like seas\n1 Waves &lt;1ft, rippled surface\n2 Small wavelets (&lt;2 ft), no white caps\n3 Large wavelets (&lt;3ft), scattered white caps\n4 Swell 3-4 ft, numerous white caps\n5 Swell &gt;5 ft, many white caps, some spray\n6 Swell &gt;10 ft, white caps everywhere, spray\nCloudCover\n0 Clear\n1 0-25% Cloudy\n2 26-50% Cloudy\n3 51-75% Cloudy\n4 76-100% Cloudy\n5 Overcast\nGlare\n0 No Glare\n1 &lt;10% of visual field\n2 10-25% of visual field\n3 25-50% of visual field\n4 50-75% of visual field\n5 &gt;75% of visual field\nWeather\n0 Clear\n1 Mist\n2 Light Rain\n3 Heavy Rain\nVisibility\n0 Clear\n1 Good\n2 Fair\n3 Poor\nHaze\n0 No\n1 Yes\nFog\n0 No\n1 Yes\nSun penetration (Sun pen)\n0 Poor\n1 Fair\n2 Good\n3 Excellent\nTurbidity\n0 Poor\n1 Fair\n2 Good\n3 Excellent",

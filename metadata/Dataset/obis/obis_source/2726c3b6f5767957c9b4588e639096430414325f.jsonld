    "description": "This project examined the distribution of benthic foraminifera and mollusca in surface sediments from two localities on the inner Labrador Shelf and from Lake Melville, a large fjord-like re-entrant in the Labrador mainland. The environment is unique in comparison to lower latitudes due to the recent glacial and postglacial history of the area. These events may have had a profound influence on species distribution. The data was collected aboard the CSS Hudson during July and August 1979 cruise. Samples were collected using piston corers, box cores and Van Veen sampler in water depths ranging from 60m to 369m. Survey results consist of presence only.\n\nMollusca data are not included in this data set but can be found in the original report. Not included in this OBIS view, the report also includes information on the physiography and sediments of the Labrador Shelf (Vilks,et al. 1982).",

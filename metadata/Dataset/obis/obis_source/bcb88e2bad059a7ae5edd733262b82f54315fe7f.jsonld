    "description": "Original provider:\nHDR Environmental, Operations and Construction, Inc.\n\nDataset credits:\nThe U.S. Navy Marine Species Monitoring Program\n\nAbstract:\nThe objective of this current survey effort was to conduct baseline surveys to further document marine mammal and sea turtle occurrence in nearshore waters around the island of Guam. This report presents the results of the Guam Marine Species Monitoring Survey conducted on the MV Island Girl from February 17 to March 3, 2011. This survey covered an area of approximately 4,100 square kilometers (km2)(1,200 square nautical miles ([nm2]) to document marine mammal\nand sea turtle distribution around the island of Guam. The approach primarily followed opportunistic survey protocols used in a recent survey around Guam (Ligon et al. 2011), which remained nearshore (within 5.6 kilometers [km] or 3 nautical miles [nm] of the coastline). ). The resulting sightings, therefore, consisted of spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris; 7 of 9 sightings) and a mixed group of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and short-finned pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus). In addition, one species of sea turtle was observed (green\nsea turtle, Chelonia mydas). Additional lines of effort following standard line-transect protocols were attempted (out to 10 nm from shore) when sea conditions permitted.\n\nPurpose:\nnot provided\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2017-08-03] Data format was updated and dataset name was changed.\n\nThe sighting of short-finned pilot whales and bottlenose dolphins on 02/22/11 was an aggregation of the two species and recorded as a single record. This sighting was split into each species in this dataset.",

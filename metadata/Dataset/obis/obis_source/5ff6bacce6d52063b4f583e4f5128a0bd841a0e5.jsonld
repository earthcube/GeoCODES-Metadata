    "description": "Skin samples were collected from live Australian snubfin (n = 31) and humpback dolphins (n = 23) along the east coast of Queensland in 2014-2015. Both species had similar δ13C and δ15N values and high (&gt;50%) isotopic niche space overlap, suggesting that they feed at similar trophic levels, have substantial dietary overlap, and both rely on similar basal food resources.

    "description": "This dataset contains, twenty-one deepsea caridean shrimp species that were identified by conventional taxonomy under seven families Pandalidae, Acanthephyridae, Oplophoridae, Crangonidae, Pasiphaeidae, Glyphocrangonidae, Hippolytidae, and Stylodactylidae. Out of twenty-one, thirteen species are new distributional records reported for the first time from the southern coast of India. Accounting to molecular analysis a total of 128 sequences of COI and 16S were deposited in the GenBank database belonging to 8 genera under 5 families from the southern coast of Indian waters.",

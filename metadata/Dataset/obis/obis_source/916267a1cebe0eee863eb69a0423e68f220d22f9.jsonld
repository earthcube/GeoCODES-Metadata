    "description": "The database covers the Haida Gwaii archipelago on the West Coast of Canada, including all species of the Haida Gwaii region from any published source, accessible collection and unpublished observations from scientists. Lists all marine plant species and maps their distributions from the first records (1911) to 1999 and includes 348 seaweed and 4 seagrass species from 456 intertidal to shallow subtidal locations. This inventory had detailed regional starting points (Hawkes et al. 1978; Scagel et al. 1993) and &gt;90% of the plant species are represented by specimens in the Phycological Herbarium of the University of British Columbia Botany Department.",

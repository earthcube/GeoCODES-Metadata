    "description": "Biological data collected on 3 cruises of Southern Surveyor between February 1997 and October 1998 in the Torres Strait, Gulf of Carpentaria and Arafura Sea under the leadership of John Salini. The aims were to identify all vertebrate and invertebrate bycatch species in prawn trawls in the northern prawn fishery and the Torres Strait. The data were collected for the Bycatch Sustainability Project.\nThis data has been republished (2022-09-05 with additional details of each occurrence where they can be one of three types:  catch composition (counts per taxa and optional aggregated weights by trawl event), catch measurements (length and/or weight) of individual taxa and/or catch specimens and their stored location. The occurrence type is recorded in occurrenceremarks.\n\n",

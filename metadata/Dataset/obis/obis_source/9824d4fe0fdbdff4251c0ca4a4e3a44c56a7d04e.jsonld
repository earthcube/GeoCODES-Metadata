    "description": "Original provider:\nCayman Islands Department of Environment\n\nDataset credits:\nData provider\nMarine Turtle Research Group\nOriginating data center\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/\">Satellite Tracking and Analysis Tool (STAT)</a>\nProject partner\nThis project represents a collaborative effort between the Cayman Islands Department of Environment and the Marine Turtle Research Group at the University of Exeter, Cornwall Campus. \nProject sponsor or sponsor description\nA satellite transmitter and associated satellite time for Murph were sponsored by the Ritz Carlton Ambassadors of the Environment Program, with additional support from the Turtles in the UK Overseas Territories (TUKOT) project and the Darwin Initiative.\n\n\nAbstract:\nEvery summer, Caribbean turtles migrate thousands of kilometers to nest in the Cayman Islands. This nesting population may once have been one of the largest in the Atlantic â€“ but today, only a handful of turtles have escaped extinction. Where do these mysterious survivors live when they are not nesting? Satellite tracking is the only way to follow the migrations of these endangered sea turtles from nesting beaches in the Cayman Islands to foraging grounds in distant countries. With the help of schools and the local community, the Department of Environment is tracking endangered Cayman turtles across the open ocean to Central America, Mexico, and the Florida Keys. The Cayman turtles travel through the waters of many different nations, and conservation efforts will depend on a clear understanding of their movements. \n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=175\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

    "description": "Original provider:\nNYSERDA, APEM, Normandeau Associates\n\nDataset credits:\nNYSERDA, Normandeau Associates Inc., APEM Ltd.\n\nAbstract:\nIn support of New York Stateâ€™s commitment to incorporating offshore wind into its energy portfolio, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) embarked on a multi-year ultra-high resolution aerial digital survey of marine resources in a 43,745.20 km2 (12,754.06 mi2) offshore planning area (OPA) in 2016. The OPA encompasses the waters of the New York Bight from Long Island southeast to the continental shelf break. Surveys are conducted on a quarterly basis, timed to coincide with periods of abundance of avian and marine species that could be vulnerable to impacts from offshore wind activities. Each survey collected images covering at least 7% of the OPA. \nFor each survey, approximately 300,000 images were collected within the OPA using a transect design. During the first survey year, special attention was also paid to the wind energy area (WEA) using a more detailed grid survey design, collecting around 100,000 images. Each survey collected images covering at least 10% of the WEA. WEA survey data are in a separate dataset.\nThere was some variation in sampling effort among surveys as a different camera system that captured a larger footprint was used after the Summer 2016 survey.\n\nYR1 consists of Survey01 Summer2016, Survey02 Fall2016, Survey03 Winter2016-17, Survey04 Spring2017.\n\nPurpose:\nThe New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) contracted with Normandeau Associates Inc. (Normandeau) and teaming partner APEM Inc. (APEM) to use high resolution aerial digital imagery to collect data on birds, marine mammals, sea turtles, cartilaginous fish, and other taxa encountered offshore. Surveys are conducted four times a year over three years. The surveys have been designed in light of available historical data and use the latest digital and sensor technology to provide high identification success. Survey results for birds, marine mammals, turtles, and cartilaginous fish are presented in semiannual reports, which will cumulatively provide insight into interseasonal and interannual variation in species composition, densities, and distributions. Reports are available at https://remote.normandeau.com/nys_docs.php.\n\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2020-08-06] Data were updated with additional attributes. Species identification was revised.\n\nhttps://remote.normandeau.com\nhttps://remote.normandeau.com/aer_docs.php?pj=6",

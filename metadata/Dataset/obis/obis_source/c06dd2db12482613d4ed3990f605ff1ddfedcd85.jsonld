    "description": "This resource includes species distribution records (presence) for taxa collected as part of a Fisheries Research Board study in an estuary in Prince Edward island.\n\nDetailed description of the study which was aimed at studying all larval types in a single locality is contained in Sullivan (1948). The belief was that identification of a number of pelecypod larvae from one area would be of practical use in shellfish investigations all along our Atlantic coast. The study which took place over four summers in the 1940s, was done at the Prince Edward Island Biological Station during the months of May to October. All the materials were collected in Malpeque Bay, PEI. This sampling location was chosen as a particularly suitable locality because of the variety of its pelecypod fauna and because its small tides, slight currents, and sheltered waters made it ideal for the gathering of specimens.\n\nAt the time of the FRB study it was known that twenty-two species of bivalves occurred regularly in the bay. In the study, the larvae of twenty of these were described in all their stages and less complete information was presented on the remaining two, Pandora gouldiana and Yoldia limatula. Ten of these larvae had been described by other authors and twelve were described in the FRB report (Sullivan 1948) for the first time.",

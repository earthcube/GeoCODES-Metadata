    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nSoutheast Fisheries Science Center, NOAA\n\nAbstract:\nA winter marine mammals survey  in Gulf of Mexico was conducted  in 1993 by NOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center to examine the distribution and estimate abundance of cetaceans in U.S. waters. The survey was followed by a similar spring survey in 1993. This dataset contains sightings of not only cetaceans but also other species including sea turtles, fish and shark observed during the ship survey.\n\nDuring the 31 survey days, 10 species were sighted, including\n\nAtlantic spotted dolphin\nClymene dolphin\nMelon-headed whale\nPantropical spotted dolphin\nPygmy sperm whale\nShort/Long-finned pilot whale\nSperm whale\nStandard Bottlenose dolphin\nStriped dolphin\n\nThe dataset  is accompanied by transect data which is provided as a separate file.\n\nPurpose:\nThe purpose of this survey is to examine the distribution and estimate abundance of cetaceans in U.S. waters.\n\nSpecific objectives of this survey are:\n\n1. Complete a line transect survey of the study area for marine mammals during daylight hours following prescribed transects.\n\n2. Collect ichthyoplankton samples for the Southeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program (SEAMAP) during the non-daylight hours using neuston, bongo and Tucker trawls.\n\n3. Obtain associated environmental and oceanographic data.\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2020-09-30] The following invalid species names were corrected according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS).\nBonaparte's Gull: Larus philadelphia (176839) =&gt; Chroicocephalus philadelphia (824040)\nLaughing Gull: Larus atricilla (176837) =&gt; Leucophaeus atricilla (824079)\nRoyal Tern: Sterna maxima (176922) =&gt; Thalasseus maximus (824142)\nSooty Tern: Sterna fuscata (176894) =&gt; Onychoprion fuscatus (824105)",

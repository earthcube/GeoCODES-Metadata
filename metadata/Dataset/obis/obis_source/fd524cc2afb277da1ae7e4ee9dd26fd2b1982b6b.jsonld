    "description": "Abundance and biomass of fish species collected during the day from 1988 to 2000 off the coast of the southeastern United States (Cape Fear, NC to Cape Canaveral, FL). Chevron traps were set on live-bottom reef areas on the continental shelf and upper slope. Chevron traps were arrowhead shaped (maximum dimensions of 1.5 m x 1.7 m x 0.6 m.; 0.91 m3 volume) and constructed of 35 mm x 35 mm square mesh plastic-coated wire. Chevron traps had one entrance funnel (“horseneck”), and one release panel to remove the catch. Each trap was soaked between 90 and 120 minutes.",

    "description": "Biological data from the IPY-CAML voyage (TAN0802) by the R/V Tangaroa. The TAN0802 voyage departed from Wellington, New Zealand on Jan 26th 2008 and returned to Wellington, New Zealand, on Mar 21st 2008. The survey was concentrated mainly on the Ross Sea and the waters around Scott and the Balleny Islands. Biological data was collected using a variety of gear, including: bottom trawls, beam trawls, epibenthic sleds, Van Veen grabs, Rosette water bottle and MOCNESS tows.\nThe voyage resulted from a announcement by the Prime Minister in 2007 for new government funding for a New Zealand Census of Antarctic Marine Life (CAML) project to support biodiversity studies in the Southern Ocean and Ross Sea Region as part of the governments Ocean Survey 20/20 (OS2020) programme and the International Polar Year (IPY) activities. The overall Project includes two phases a) data collection voyage and b) data analysis and reporting. \nThe recognition of International Polar Year (IPY) throughout the globe from March 2007 to March 2009 has provided the impetus for a large international effort to conduct collaborative research both in Antarctica and the Arctic, spanning two summer seasons in both regions. New Zealand is participating in a range of both terrestrial and marine projects for IPY that are important, not only nationally, but also in the international science arena.\nThe Census of Antarctic Marine Life (CAML) is a major multi-national IPY Programme that New Zealandâ€™s project is part of. This project forms a particularly important component of the international CAML Programme, as it will not only be part of the circum-polar national surveys, but will provide an opportunity to compare fauna and ecosystems from opposite sides of the globe including the two most significant shelf areas in Antarctica-the Ross Sea and the Weddell Sea.",

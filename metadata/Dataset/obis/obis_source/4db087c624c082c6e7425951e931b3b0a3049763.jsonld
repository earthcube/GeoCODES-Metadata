    "description": "Larvae of fish from families Engraulidae and Clupeidae were sampled. Sampling was mainly pelagic, thus mainly by Petersen's young fish trawl. Data proceed from the Thor expeditions 1908-1910 but data from other expeditions (Thor 1905 and 1906) and other vessels (Nordboen and Pangan) are incorporated in the report, encompassing years 1904-1911",

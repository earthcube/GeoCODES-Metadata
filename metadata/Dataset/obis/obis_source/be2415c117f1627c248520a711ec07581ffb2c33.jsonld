    "description": "This vegetation survey was undertaken in 1996. This dataset represents the vegetation on the ground at the time of the survey and reflects the data and methods used to create the mapped polygons. The dataset has been revised in 2015 to include community descriptions but has not been updated to reflect the vegetation on the ground. The Darwin Remnant Vegetation Survey is considered a more up-to-date representation of vegetation for this area.\nThis dataset is hosted by the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS), University of Tasmania, on behalf of the NT Government for the purposes of the Seamap Australia collaborative project (testing a national marine benthic habitat classification scheme).

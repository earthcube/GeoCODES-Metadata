    "description": "This datasets has 10688 records representing 83 terminal taxa collected from the Kara Sea between 1997 and 2001. In the zooplankton, for which most data were available, four regional aggregations were separated: (1) the rivers and estuaries of the Southern Kara Sea, (2) the south-western and (3) the central Kara Sea, and (4) the northern troughs and slope.",

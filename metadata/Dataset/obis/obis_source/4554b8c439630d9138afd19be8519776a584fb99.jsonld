    "description": "The Canadian Wildlife Service maintains a waterbird colony database which holds colony census information such as counts of birds, nests, burrows, and holes observed at individual seabird colonies located in the Atlantic region of Canada. The methods used to conduct censuses are varied as it is not possible to regularly visit every colony. Each record in the colonies database census table references the census method.\n\nVersion 1 of this resource contains presence information of adult birds only. Future versions may contain more information. In the meantime please contact CWS directly should you require more information.",

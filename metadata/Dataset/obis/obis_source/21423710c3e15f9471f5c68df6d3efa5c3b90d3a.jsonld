    "description": "This dataset contains the species occurrence records collected as part of a stude designed to describe the occurrence and distribution patterns of several relatively ubiquitous indigenous species of Foraminifera observed in the Minas Basin. The study area environment is unique due to its exceptionally large tidal range creating currents well in excess of that required to erode and transport Foraminifera. The data was collected from 120 sediment samples collected during the spring and autumn of 1976. Spring samples in late May were collected from CSS Dawson using a medium Van Veen Grab (30cm x 30cm). The autumn samples were collected in September and October from a small boat using an Ekman grab (18cm x 18cm) or on foot. Samples were collected in water depths ranging from 1m to 25m.",

    "description": "This dataset is from a study that was concerned chiefly with parasitic copepods collected from the gills of marine fishes taken in New Zealand and Antarctic waters. A total of 18 copepod species was collected from New Zealand waters. These species represented seven families and nine genera and were collected from 18 families and 19 genera of fish hosts, a total of 621 copepods from 258 fishes. Seven of the New Zealand copepod species and the only two collected from Antarctic fishes.\nDuring March 1960, 616 specimens of 35 species of fishes were collected from the marine waters of New Zealand and examined for parasites. Of these, 258 individuals, or 38.6 per cent, representing 21 species were infected with parasitic copepods. From January 1961 to February 1962 and during November and December 1964 a total of 599 specimens of 13 species of fishes were collected from the waters adjacent to the Wilkes and McMurdo Sound stations in the Antarctic. Only 37 individuals, or 6.4 per cent, representing four species were infected with parasitic copepods.\nOnly two species of copepods were found on the Antarctic fishes. Neoscutellidium yeatmani, is described and Clavellodes intermedium (Quidor, 1906) Wilson, 1915 is redescribed. One new locality record is established.",

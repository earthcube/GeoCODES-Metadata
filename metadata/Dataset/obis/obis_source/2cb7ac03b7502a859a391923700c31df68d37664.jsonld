    "description": "Surface and subsurface samples were collected in marsh and estuarine environments to determine foraminiferal distributions. Samples from the marsh area were obtained on foot during low tide. Since the marsh material was rootbound, a stainless steel corer was developed by the author to obtain surface samples. The collection of subsurface material was obtained using a posthole auger. The estuarine samples were obtained from a small craft at high tide and used a lightweight box corer. Samples were obtained in water depths ranging from 0.1metres to 5metres. Samples were sieved through .5mm and 0.63mm sieves and fixed in a solution of buffered formalin and Rose Bengal and then preserved in alcohol. Information about other marsh areas around Nova Scotia is also provided in the original survey data report (Scott, 1977). The original survey report also contains plates with images of collected foraminifera.\n\n\nThe OBIS view of this dataset includes only information on species presence. Count can be found in the original data report. \n\nThis research was collected as partial fulfilment of a Ph.D at Dalhousie University’s department of Geology. The purpose was to contribute to the authors work to determine if marsh foraminifera can be demonstrated to exhibit a strong vertical zonation similar to surrounding plants. If true, a valuable tool is available to examine Holocene sea level changes.",

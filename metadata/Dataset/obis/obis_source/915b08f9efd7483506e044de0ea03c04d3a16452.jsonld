    "description": "This data contains at-sea GPS tracks of little penguins (Eudyptula minor) tagged at three colonies around Storm Bay, Tasmania (Boronia Beach, Wedge Island and Bruny Island Neck) over the 2015/16 summer breeding season. This data was collected as part of an honours thesis submitted in 2016. Metadata details are at http://metadata.imas.utas.edu.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/metadata.show?uuid=db737c5a-708f-4929-b0f6-376366a8a5a5\nThe tracking data occurrences is complimented with the deployment and retrieval times (occurrenceids tagged with -deploy and -retrive respectively). Additional information of the number of chicks in the nest, their estimated age, the bill biometrics of the adult bird and its weight upon deployment are linked to the initial deployment record.",

    "description": "The dataset contains details of the biota caught during plankton surveys around New Zealand and the south western Pacific although some occurrence data is included from other oceans sourced from the digitisation of journal articles from New Zealand authors. A large source from this dataset is provided by the New Zealand Ministry of Primary Industries from its \"plankton\" and \"rocklob\" databases. This dataset records all biological specimens collected during plankton sampling including fish, larvae, and eggs. This dataset does not include and data from Constant Plankton Recorders.",

Loggerhead turtle movements will be compared with the distributions of commercial fishing and dredging activity and results will be used to make management recommendations to protect adult loggerhead sea turtles and their habitats. A total of twelve satellite transmitters will be deployed from Jekyll (7) and Cumberland Islands (5).  Our tracking project also provides a unique educational opportunity for students to learn more about Georgia?s loggerhead turtles and the coastal marine ecosystems. During the spring of 2004, Sea Island, Georgia, will be the host of the historic G-8 Conference, where world leaders will meet to discuss important global economic issues. School kids from grades K-5 were given the opportunity to submit names for eight of the turtles.  Over 1,200 Georgia students in kindergarten through fifth grade took part in the sea turtle naming contest. Turtles were named in honor of the main eight countries participating in the G-8 Conference including the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, Russia, France, Italy, Germany and Canada.  The winning children were then invited to take part in a special ceremony with Governor Sonny Perdue at the State Capitol.  Click on each individual turtle to get more information on the winning students.  There are wonderful stories behind the children and each name that was chosen.Our project will study the movements of Georgia?s adult loggerhead sea turtles during their nesting season (May-August), document their migratory movements and their  foraging habitats (home range) and then we will make a comparison with known fishing activity in the area.  \n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=24\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

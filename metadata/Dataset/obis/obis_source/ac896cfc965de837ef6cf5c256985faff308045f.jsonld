    "description": "This is the Nova Scotia Museum database for marine organisms, including birds, mammals, and fishes. It contains mostly Nova Scotia material but there is also representation from New Brunswick, Newfoundland, the Northwest Territories, and other parts of North America. The ichthyology collection is the most extensive with over 2800 specimens. Temporally, specimens were collected from 1873 to 2002. The dataset was developed from the Nova Scotia Museum of Natural History (NSMNH) - Museum Information Management System (MIMS) as an electronic catalogue of specimen and collecting information.\n\nThis resource contains only the georeferenced records.",

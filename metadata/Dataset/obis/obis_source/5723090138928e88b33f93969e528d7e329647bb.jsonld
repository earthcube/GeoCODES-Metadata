    "description": "The Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory (MAGNT) Annelid Collection comprises about 27,000 lots of registered specimens, including 71 holotypes and 223 paratype lots.\n\nThe Polychaete marine bristle worms are by far the best represented group, but the collection also includes earthworms and leeches (Clitellata).\n\nThe Polychaete collection has representatives from marine and estuarine areas throughout Northern Australia, in particular Darwin Harbour, Bing Bong (MacArthur River) and Gove.\nThe main focus of the collection is the Polychaete marine bristle worms. Other worm-like phyla are also held at the MAGNT, including Echiura (spoon worms), Sipuncula (peanut worms), Chaetognatha (arrow worms), Enteropneusta (acorn worms), Nemertea (ribbon worms), Nematoda (round worms), Phoronida, Platyhelminthes (flat worms) and Priapulida.\nThis dataset is of marine species sourced from the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) January 2019 (https://collections.ala.org.au/public/show/co142). Taxa have been matched to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) and if not then matched to the Australian Faunal Directory (AFD)",

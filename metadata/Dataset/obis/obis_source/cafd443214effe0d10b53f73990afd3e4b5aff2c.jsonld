    "name": "Southern right whales wintering in the Auckland Islands, 1995-1998",
    "description": "Historically, southern right whales were widely distributed in New Zealand waters. This population, was driven to commercial extinction following extensive exploitation during the early 19th century (Dawbin 1986). It was further depleted by illegal Soviet hunting in 1950-1970 (Tormosov et al. 1998). While right whale sightings around mainland New Zealand remain rare, up to 165 whales can be found at the Auckland Is in a single day during winter. Despite what appears to be adequate habitat along the eastern coastline, the whales' distribution is largely limited to Port Ross, Laurie Harbour and waters around Enderby I. The relatively small area where so many whales congregate means that at peak season the density of whales at the Auckland Is is very high (approximately 8 whales/km2). The residency period extends from at least early May to at least the end of September, with peak numbers in July and August. ",

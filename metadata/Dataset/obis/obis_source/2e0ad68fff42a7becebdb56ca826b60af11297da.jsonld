    "description": "Nine one litre seawater samples were collected using sterile Nalgene bottles from the surface at Coral Bay, which is located within the World Heritage site of Ningaloo Reef on the northwest coast of Australia. Three samples were collected on the 17th of March 2015 at 9:00 am from Coral Bay jetty (−23.154793, 113.766328), and six samples were collected from within the lagoon (−23.154793, 113.766328); three at 5:30 pm on the 17th of March and three at 6:30 am on the 18th of March. Equal volumes of each of the nine DNA extracts were pooled together and used to prepare a single shotgun library using the Nextera XT DNA library kit (Illumina, San Diego, USA). Assignment of sequences to taxa at a particular taxonomic level was assessed using the software MEGAN 5.11.370 using a Min Score of 100 and a Top Percent of 10 under the LCA Parameters.\nData sourced from Atlas of Living Australia https://collections.ala.org.au/public/show/dr8132  on 2023-01-19",

    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nNOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center\n\nAbstract:\nThe Mariana Archipelago Cetacean Survey (MACS) was a shipboard line-transect survey within 50 nmi of the Mariana Islands within the Guam and CNMI exclusive economic zone (8 May - 6 June 2015). Three days were lost to diversion out of the study area due to Typhoon Dolphin. All regions of the study area were at least partially surveyed as planned, with some gaps in transect survey coverage due to the weather diversion. There were 42 cetacean sightings that included 9 identified species, as well as groups of dolphins, whales, and beaked whales that could not be identified to species.\n\nSupplemental information:\nData were collected under NMFS permit 15240.\nThe data included here are the sightings and on-effort tracks recorded within WinCruz survey software and extracted from the QA/QC'd DAS file using the R package swfscDAS (https://smwoodman.github.io/swfscDAS).\n\nAttributes for fields within the trackline files:\nCruise - see description in attribute table below\nsegnum - segment number for continuous on-effort line\nDate - Local date m/dd/yyyy\nTimeStart - Local time at start of on-effort segment\nLatStart - Latitude in decimal degrees at starting point of on-effort segment\nLongStart - Longitude in decimal degrees at starting point of on-effort segment\nTimeEnd - Local time at end of on-effort segment\nLatEnd - Latitude in decimal degrees at end point of on-effort segment\nLongEnd - Longitude in decimal degrees at end point of on-effort segment\nMode - see description in attribute table below\nEffType - see description in attribute table below\navgSpdKt - average speed (knots) of the ship over the on-effort segment traveled\navgBft - average Beaufort Sea State over the on-effort segment\n\nOther data not included here:\nPhotos and biopsy samples were collected and satellite tags were deployed during some sightings. Acoustic detections were recorded from a towed hydrophone array. Sonobuoys were deployed opportunistically. High-frequency Acoustic Recording Packages (HARP) were recovered and redeployed off Saipan and Tinian and deployed off Pagan. Oceanographic data were collected (CTD, XBT).",

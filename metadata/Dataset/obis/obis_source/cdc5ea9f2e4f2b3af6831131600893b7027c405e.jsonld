    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nNOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center\n\nAbstract:\nThe Hawaiian Islands Cetacean Ecosystem Assessment Survey (HICEAS) was a collaborative project between the Southwest  and Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Centers  during which two NOAA ships (MacArthur II and Oscar Elton Sette) conducted line-transect surveys throughout the entire Hawaii exclusive economic zone (EEZ) over four months (August - December 2010). This dataset represents the surveys (4 Legs) aboard the MacArthur II that began and ended in LaJolla, CA (4 August - 10 December). There were 290 cetacean sightings which included 22 identified species as well as unidentified dolphins, large whales and beaked whales.\n\nPurpose:\nHICEAS 2010 was the second Hawaii EEZ-wide survey. The sighting data were used to estimate the abundance and distribution of cetaceans in Hawaiian waters (Bradford et al. 2017, 2021).\n\nSupplemental information:\nData were collected under NMFS permit 14097.\n\nThe data included here are the sightings and on-effort tracks recorded within WinCruz survey software and extracted from the QA/QC'd DASALL file using the R package swfscDAS (https://smwoodman.github.io/swfscDAS).\n\nAttributes for fields within the trackline files:\nCruise - see description in attribute table below\nsegnum - segment number for continuous on-effort line\nDate - Local date m/dd/yyyy\nTimeStart - Local time at start of on-effort segment\nLatStart - Latitude in decimal degrees at starting point of on-effort segment\nLongStart - Longitude in decimal degrees at starting point of on-effort segment\nTimeEnd - Local time at end of on-effort segment\nLatEnd - Latitude in decimal degrees at end point of on-effort segment\nLongEnd - Longitude in decimal degrees at end point of on-effort segment\nMode - see description in attribute table below\nEffType - see description in attribute table below\navgSpdKt - average speed (knots) of the ship over the on-effort segment traveled\navgBft - average Beaufort Sea State over the on-effort segment\n\n\nOther data not included here: Photos and biopsy samples were collected during some sightings. Acoustic detections were recorded from a towed hydrophone array. Sonobuoys were deployed opportunistically. Oceanographic data were collected (CTD, XBT).\n\n\nSee the following dataset for the sightings and effort aboard the Oscar Elton Sette.\nPIFSC &amp; SWFSC, Cetacean Survey, HICEAS 2010, Cruise 1642, NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center",

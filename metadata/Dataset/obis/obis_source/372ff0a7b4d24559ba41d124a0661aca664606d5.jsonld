    "description": "This dataset contains pinniped observation data conducted during shipboard transects in the Chukchi Sea during the 9 August - 3 September 2015 Arctic Marine Biodiversity Observing Network (AMBON) research cruise. The dataset is three comma-separated values (csv) files describing the dates, times, latitude, longitude, species and best-high-low estimates of numbers for each pinniped (seals, seal lions, and walrus) sighting. This dataset was exported from the marine bird and mammal observation software WinCruz from the entire survey, and later transformed from the native WinCruz format into Darwin Core formatted tables (DwC, occurrence core), with DwC  term names as column names.",

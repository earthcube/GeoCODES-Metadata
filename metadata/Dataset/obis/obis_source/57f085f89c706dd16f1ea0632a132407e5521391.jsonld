    "description": "This dataset comes from a paper that describes four species of the genus Diaphus. Three of these are in the subgeneric group with a suborbital luminous organ and are members of the D. fulgens species group with a raised AOa1 photophore. D. impostor sp. nov. from the Indo-West Pacific is most similar to D. aliciae, differing in lower gill raker count and smaller size. D. wisneri sp. nov. from north of Hawaii and south Pacific lacks a luminous scale at the PLO and has a lower gill raker count than similar species. D. kora sp. nov. from north-east of New Zealand has a large luminous scale at the PLO, and a longer Vn and lower gill raker counts than similar species. D. kapalae sp. nov. from the south-western Pacific is most similar to D. splendidus and D. antonbruuni, from which it differs by the presence of an Ant, higher gill raker counts, and position of the VLO photophore.",

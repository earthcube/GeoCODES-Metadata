    "description": "Interest in the deep seas has increased dramatically in the last decade, due to the potential presence of natural resources. Although Colombia holds a large submerged territory, knowledge of the seabed and its biodiversity beyond a depth of 1000 meters is very limited. During 2015-2017, Anadarko Colombia Company (ACC) carried out hydrocarbon exploratory activities in the Southern Colombian Caribbean, at depths between 375 m and 2500 m. As an opportunistic result from these activities, several organisms from different phyla were spotted in ROV and towed camera surveys. Data here includes different groups of Echinoderm reported (Crinoidea, Asteroidea, Ophiuroidea and Echinoidea) in southern Colombian Caribbean, at depths between 120 m and 2568 m. The images were separated by Class, and the Echinoderm were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level. \nThe data presented here corresponds to 361 occurrences of deep-sea echinoderms, with a taxonomic coverage of 4 class, 11 orders, 17 families, 11 genus and 10 species.",

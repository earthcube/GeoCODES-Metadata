    "description": "Records collected by Birds Australia between 1977 and 1981, each survey was ascribed to a grid with the coords given as the central point. Grids size varied, with most being 10-minute grids or 1-degree grids.\nThis dataset is a subset of marine species downloaded from ALA https://collections.ala.org.au/public/show/dr571 on 2020-07-14. Many records have missing dates but the data has been collected between 1976 and 1984.",

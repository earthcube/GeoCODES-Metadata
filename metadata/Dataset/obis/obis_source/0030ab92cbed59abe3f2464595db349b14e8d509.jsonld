The OAG is a Spanish State foundation recently created and based in Tenerife, Canary Islands, aiming to monitor environmental conditions of the sea and the state of biodiversity and marine protected areas in waters around the Canary Islands and, extensively, the archipelago of Madeira and the Azores (the Atlantic subregion called Macaronesia). One of its objectives is also the follow-up of the impacts of large marine-based infrastructures, such as large ports.\n\nPurpose:\nLoggerheads are present in the archipelago the entire the year, but there are no breeding colonies. To study an open resident segment of the Atlantic population, satellite tracking data from previous projects were compiled, and 19 additional animals marked, increasing the dataset to 39 turtles, with 14,608 high quality signals. Each year observation\ntransects were performed on at least three islands for estimating the relative\ndensity of turtles. To analyze the segment size/age structure as well as the negative impacting factors on the species, data from all recovery centers in the Canaries were compiled and studied (2,836 specimens, 1998-2012). These dataseries are far from being optimal, but constitute the best available information at present.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=315\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

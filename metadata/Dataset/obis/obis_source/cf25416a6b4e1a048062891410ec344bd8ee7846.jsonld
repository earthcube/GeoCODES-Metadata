    "description": "Sampling data captured in Oceanic Exploration Research JOGMEC has implemented the following works as the crust exploration activities during the year 2016: (1) Exploration work A sampling survey, acoustic survey, and seafloor observation were conducted according to the exploration plan. The exploration target was the JA02 Seamount and BMS drilling, ROV survey, MBES survey were performed with the marine resource research vessel Hakurei owned by JOGMEC during a period of 29 days from April 11 to May 9. In the BMS drilling, 25 holes were drilled at 13 sites to collect 22 core samples. In the ROV survey, 278 kg of samples were collected for benefication and metallurgy tests. In the MBES survey, benthic landform data including the foot of the JA02 seamount were collected. In addition to the surveys with Hakurei, automatic measurement of the crust thickness was conducted at the JA02 Seamount with a chartered vessel owned by a private company during a period of 21 days from February 3 to 23. Although the actual survey could be made only for two days due to bad weather, we made 3D mapping of the acoustic measurement result of the crust thickness on the benthic plane. The measured crust thickness was found consistent with the BMS data collected from the surrounding area. ",

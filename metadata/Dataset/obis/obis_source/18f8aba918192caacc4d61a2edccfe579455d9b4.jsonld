    "name": "A Very Large Spawning Aggregation of the basketwork eel, Diastobranchus capensis, on the small (3 km2) Patience Seamount off southeast Australia.",
    "description": "Samples and data from the eel aggregation were collected opportunistically during three surveys that aimed primarily to map the seabed and associated benthic biodiversity on the continental slope off southern Tasmania  in an area containing a cluster of small volcanic seamounts. Details of the three surveys are respectively at https://www.marine.csiro.au/data/trawler/survey_details.cfm?survey=SS200702  https://www.marine.csiro.au/data/trawler/survey_details.cfm?survey=IN2015_E02 and https://www.marine.csiro.au/data/trawler/survey_details.cfm?survey=IN2018_V06\nIf this data has been used in any products, please acknowledge with the following: We acknowledge the use of the CSIRO Marine National Facility (https://ror.org/01mae9353) in undertaking this research.\n",

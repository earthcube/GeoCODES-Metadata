    "name": "Larvae collected near deep-sea hydrothermal vent fields for microbiome study",
    "description": "This dataset provides the sampling locations and identifications for a total of 60 larvae collected near deep-sea hydrothermal vent fields and used in a microbiome study by Carrier et al. (2020, submitted). The larvae were collected near hydrothermal vent fields on the East Pacific Rise (EPR 9Â°50'N vent field), on the Mariana Back-Arc Spreading Center (near Snail and Archaean vent fields), and in Pescadero Basin (Auka vent field) in the Gulf of California. This dataset is derived from a dataset in the Biological and Chemical Oceanography Data Management Office (BCO-DMO) repository (Beaulieu et al., 2021, doi:10.26008/1912/bco-dmo.839476.1) with the addition of two Darwin Core terms recommended for the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF; countryCode and kingdom). See the dataset in BCO-DMO for acquisition description, data columns removed that were not in the Darwin Core standard (e.g., Lowest_level_taxon_name_or_morphotype, microbiome_16S_Dryad), and associatedMedia. Note that the use of the Darwin Core term habitat differs from the standard definition; we describe the habitat as \"hydrothermal vent\" ENVO term http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00000215 for those taxa for which we are confident that the adults live at a hydrothermal vent, otherwise NotDetermined. Funding to collect specimens was from the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) OCE-0424953 and OCE-1028862 and the Dalio Explore Fund, and funding to standardize these data to Darwin Core for sharing through the Ocean Biodiversity Information System was from NSF DEB-1558904 and OCE-1829773.",

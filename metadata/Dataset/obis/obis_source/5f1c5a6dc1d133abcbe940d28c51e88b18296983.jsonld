    "description": "The herpetology collections include all reptile and amphibian species presently know to occur in Queensland. Many of these are endemic to narrowly defined habitats. Of particular interest are species occurring in the Brigalow Belt and the Wet Tropics World Heritage area.\n\nCollection strengths include:\n- comprehensive skeletal material of marine turtles;\n\n- type specimens representing some of the most significant Australian herpetological discoveries dating back to the 1880s.\nThis dataset is of marine species sourced from the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) January 2019 (https://collections.ala.org.au/public/show/co153). Taxa have been matched to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) and if not then matched to the Australian Faunal Directory (AFD)",

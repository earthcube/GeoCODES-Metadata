    "description": "This data set contains the at sea data collected aboard the F/V Northwest Explorer for the International Year of the Salmon (IYS) survey in 2022 in the northwestern Gulf of Alaska. This data package contains three separate components; event, catch, and specimen. The event data contains all of the sampling event information, including time, location, and duration. All dates and times are in UTC, and all length measurements are in meters. The catch data contains all of the catch records, as counts and weights, for each species/taxa at each station. The sampling method for every catch weight should be total weight, and all weights are in kilograms. The specimen data contains individual lengths and weights for sampled individuals from each station. Specimen lengths are in centimeters and specimen weights are in kilograms.",

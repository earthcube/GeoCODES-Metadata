    "description": "Original provider:\nUFL Wading Bird Research Group\n\nDataset credits:\nData provider\nUFL Wading Bird Research Group\nOriginating data center\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/\">Satellite Tracking and Analysis Tool (STAT)</a>\nProject partner\nThis is a cooperative project involving the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the University of Florida, the National Audubon Society, the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources and the University of Georgia's Savannah River Ecology Laboratory.\n\n\nAbstract:\nWe are deploying satellite transmitters on Wood storks to examine their large-scale movements, breeding season foraging range and habitat use, breeding site tenacity over time, and habitat use during the non-breeding season. Most storks were captured via rocket netting, although a few were captured with a drop net.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=142\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

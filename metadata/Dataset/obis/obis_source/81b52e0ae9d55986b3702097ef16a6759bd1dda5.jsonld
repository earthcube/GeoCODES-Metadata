    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nNOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC)\n\nAbstract:\nDuring spring (3 April – 15 May 2019) the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) conducted aerial abundance surveys targeting marine mammals and sea turtles. The southwestern extent was New Jersey and the northeastern extent was off of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada on the Scotia Shelf. The surveys covered waters from the coastline to about the 2000-m depth contour. Track lines were flown 183 m (600 ft) above the water surface, at about 200 kph (110 knots). The two-independent team methodology was used to collect data. Approximately 10,392 km of on-effort track lines were surveyed, where 89% of this effort was in Beaufort 3 and below.\n\nPurpose:\nThe objectives of this aerial flight was to collect the data needed to estimate abundance of cetaceans and turtles in the study area and to investigate how the animals’ distribution and abundance relate to their ecosystem.\n\nSupplemental information:\nThe survey code is TONE19SPR.\n\nPerpendicular distance to the animal is not publicly available.

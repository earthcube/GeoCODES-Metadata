    "description": "In 1936 Harold M. Rogers published his university thesis 'The Estuary of the Saint John River'. This document is not accessible online but a pdf version may be obtained by contacting the University of Toronto directly.\n\n\nIn his thesis Rogers states that observations were primarily restricted to the lower part of the estuary with the majority of the sampling taking place on Kennebecasis Bay and Long Beach. His thesis is divided into three parts: physiography; study of the flora and fauna; and the fish and fisheries.\n\nThis resource contains species occurrence records extracted from the thesis text. This version of the dataset includes simple species occurrence records for the area of the estuary. The thesis (Rogers 1936) contains detailed descriptions of the various taxa.",

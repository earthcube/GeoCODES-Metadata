    "description": "This study investigated killer whale interactions with two geographically isolated blue-eye trevalla (Hyperoglyphe antarctica) fisheries operating in temperate waters off Amsterdam/St. Paul Islands (Indian Ocean) and south-eastern Australia. These two fisheries differ in the fishing technique used (vertical vs. demersal longlines), effort, catch, fleet size and fishing area size. Using 7-year (2010-16) long fishing and observation datasets, this study estimated the\nlevels of killer whale interactions and examined the influence of spatio-temporal and operational variables on the probability of vessels to experience interactions.",

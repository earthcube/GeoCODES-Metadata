    "description": "Original provider:\nHDR Environmental, Operations and Construction, Inc.\n\nDataset credits:\nThe U.S. Navy Marine Species Monitoring Program\n\nAbstract:\nThe data in this dataset represent sightings that occurred during nearshore humpback whale monitoring beginning in \nJanuary 2015 through May 2019 off the coast of Virginia Beach, VA. Non-systematic vessel trackline data for each season \nis included in layers separated  for 5 seasons of effort (2015, 2015/2016, 2016/2017, 2017/2018, 2018/2019). Work was \nperformed under HDR task orders CTO 54, TO 33, 17F4013, and 19F4005 (IDIQ contract awards N62470-10-D-3011 and N62470-\n15-8006, NAVFAC LANT).\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2020-06-05] Data in 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 were added.\n[2020-01-28] Data of season 2 (TO13; Dec2015-May2016) and \nseason 3 (TO33; Nov2016-Mar2017) were added.\n\nSightings and effort data were entered and organized in \nthis geodatabase by HDR. Source data was provided by HDR \nunder the MSM IDIQ contract. Sighting locations represent \nactual animal locations. Sightings and effort data for \nthis project were collected using a prototype collection \napplication. Because this application used a different \ndatabase structure, there are no environmentals associated \nwith the effort tracks.\n\nSurvey tracklines (aggregated over time) are available \nonline and included in a downloadable zip file (shapefile \nformat).",

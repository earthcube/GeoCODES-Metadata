The project is in collaboration with the Society for the Protection of Turtles in Northern Cyprus (SPoT) and the Department of Environmental Protection. In Northern Cyprus both green and loggerhead turtles nest. Green turtles in the Mediterranean are listed as critically endangered by the <a href=\"http://iucn.org//\">IUCN</a>, with estimates suggesting that there are as few as 300-400 females nesting annually in this region. Loggerhead turtles nest in slightly greater numbers, with approximately 2000-3000 females nesting annually. Approximately 30 % of the green and 10% of the loggerhead turtles in the Mediterranean nest in Northern Cyprus.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=7\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

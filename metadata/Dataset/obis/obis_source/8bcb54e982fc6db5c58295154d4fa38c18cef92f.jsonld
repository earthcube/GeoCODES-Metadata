    "description": "This is a dataset of at-sea observations of seabirds dating from 1969 to 1990.\nThe data was recorded using guidelines for the Australasian Seabird Mapping Scheme and counts seabirds seen from a ship during a 10 minute period. The data includes geolocations of the sightings, bird species, numbers and behaviour, observer and ship name, and observation date and time.\nIt has been built from data elements extracted by Te Papa staff from the at-sea bird observations recorded in the logbooks of Captain John Arthur Francis Jenkins (1928-1989) and count cards held by the convenor of the Australasian Seabird Mapping Scheme. Metadata record is https://catalogue.data.govt.nz/dataset/at-sea-observations-of-seabirds-1969-to-1990\nThe logbooks of Captain Jenkins are held by the Archives of the Auckland War Memorial Museum.",

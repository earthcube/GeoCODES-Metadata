    "description": "NWSJEMS was a A$7.7m marine environmental study of the North West Shelf, jointly funded by CSIRO and the Western Australian Government. The overarching objective was to develop and demonstrate practical science-based methods that could support integrated regional planning and multiple-use management of the North West Shelf marine ecosystems. This datasets is historic species occurrences covering marine and some terrestrial species.\nProject information at http://www.cmar.csiro.au/nwsjems/ and https://coastalresearch.csiro.au/?q=node/56",

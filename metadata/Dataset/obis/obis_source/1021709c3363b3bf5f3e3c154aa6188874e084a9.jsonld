    "description": "The Department of Environment, Land, Water &amp; Planning works in partnership with a range of agencies and stakeholders to protect and preserve Victoria’s native landscape through a range of biodiversity, wildlife and community programs. We manage threatened species conservation and recovery, biodiversity research, invasive species, and climate change adaptation strategies. - See more at: http://www.delwp.vic.gov.au/environment-and-wildlife#sthash.giDedj4S.dpuf\nThe Victorian Biodiversity Atlas (VBA) is the web-based information system designed to manage information about native and naturalised species occurring in Victoria. The system includes species attribute information, including origin and conservation status, along with more than six million records of species distribution and abundance. All the published records have been through the verification process of the VBA which includes review by a panel of Victorian experts. The VBA includes the data submitted to DELWP from external sources as well as the Department’s own data collections from systematic surveys and general observations. For further information and access to the VBA please go to the DELWP website http://www.depi.vic.gov.au/environment-and-wildlife/biodiversity/victorian-biodiversity-atlas)\nThe VBA taxa has been validated using the World Register of Marine Species (http://www.marinespecies.org) and has been included in this dataset if it's habitat is marine. The field scientificnameId contains the WoRMS identifier.",

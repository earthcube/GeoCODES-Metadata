    "description": "Foraminifera (often abbreviated to \"forams\") are acellular organisms (protists) that form shells (tests) of calcium carbonate or cemented grains of sand or other material which, when the animals die, may form calcareous sand. The purpose of the study was to determine the species of benthic foraminifera present in Laucala Bay, and to investigate the role of large foraminifera, especially the soritid Marginopora vertebralis (Quoy &amp; Gaimard, 1830) in supplying carbonate sediments to a lagoonal sedimentary system in Fiji, namely the Nukubuco Reef flat in Laucala Bay. A total of 68 different species from 48 different genera were identified from the 13 sites sampled and the species classification and taxonomy were determined.",

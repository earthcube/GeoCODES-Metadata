    "name": "Decapods collected with epibenthic sledge from Rhodes Isl., north-eastern Aegean Sea, Greece",
    "description": "The material listed here came from three sites of the Rhodian coastline, chosen according to their proximity to the Hydrobiological Station of Rhodes. It was obtained within June 2018 from the coastal shallow waters of the island, over a mixed substrate of patches of Posidonia oceanica and sand with an epibenthic sledge bearing a bag made of plankton net with 1 mm mesh size, towed from a fishing vessel of 8.25 m length and a 38 Kw engine. Most samplings took place during the early night hours. ",

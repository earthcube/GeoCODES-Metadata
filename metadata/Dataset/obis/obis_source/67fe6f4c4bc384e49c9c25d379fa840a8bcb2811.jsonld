    "description": "The Fisheries Ecology Division (FED, https://swfsc.noaa.gov/GroundfishAnalysis/) of the Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) has conducted a midwater trawl survey off central California since 1983 with the primary goal of developing pre-recruit indices for young-of-the-year (YOY) rockfish (Sebastes spp.). The survey also samples numerous other components of the epipelagic micronekton, including other YOY groundfish (such as Pacific hake, Merluccius productus, and sanddab, Citharichthys spp ), coastal pelagic fishes (such as Pacific sardine, Sardinops sagax, and northern anchovy, Engraulis mordax) and other forage species. Additional details regarding the survey methods and results are described in Ralston et al. (2015) and Sakuma et al.

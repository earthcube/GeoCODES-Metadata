    "description": "Biological data collected on Southern Surveyor cruise SS 01/97. This cruise took place in southern Tasmanian Continental Slope waters during 20 January - 1 February 1997, under the leadership of Tony Koslow, as part of an Tasmanian Seamounts study. Biological data collected on this cruise include photographic surveys of four seamounts, dredge samples, faunal samples (including corals and many other benthic invertebrates) and fish samples. Samples of several species of corals, including Solenosmilia variabilis, were also taken for genetic analysis, and rock samples taken for age determination of the seamounts.\nReports, metadata and other data from this voyage are at https://www.marine.csiro.au/data/trawler/survey_details,cfm?survey=SS199701\n\nThis data has been republished (2022-09-05 with additional details of each occurrence where they can be one of three types:  catch composition (counts per taxa and optional aggregated weights by trawl event), catch measurements (length and/or weight) of individual taxa and/or catch specimens and their stored location. The occurrence type is recorded in occurrenceremarks.\n",

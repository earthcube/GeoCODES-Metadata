    "description": "Data show length (cm) and weight (g) of Trematomus bernacchii from four sites along a gradient south in the direction of the current from the Davis Station wastewater outfall (Outfall (0km); Torkler Rocks (1km); Warriner Island (4km) and Kazak Island (9km)) and two reference sites north of the outfall (Long Fjord (9kmN) and Bandits Hut (16km N). Fish were collected in the summer of 2012/13 using line and box traps. Fish were transported immediately back to the lab for analysis.\n\nGross body measurements were taken from fish used in an multiple-line-of-evidence assessment of station derived contamination impact.\nQuality: Note from the AADC, 2018-08-02:\n\nThe original datasheet was reformatted to fit IPT Biodiversity.AQ standard. The new datasheet provides the dataset ID, record number, event date, decimal latitude, decimal longitude, locality, continent, country, occurrence, and basis of record. The individuals measurements provided are: length (measurement unit in cm), and weight (measurement unit in grams). The taxonomical organisation is provided to the lowest taxonomical rank that could be determined, after matched in WoRMS (World Register of Marine Species).",

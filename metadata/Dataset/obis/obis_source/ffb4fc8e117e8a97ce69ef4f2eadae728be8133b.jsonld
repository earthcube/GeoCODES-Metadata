Satellite transmitters attached in the 2006/2007 nesting season have been funded by the Large Pelagics Research Centre (University of New Hampshire) through National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Agency award NA04NMF4550391. This project was also made possible by funding receieved from the <a href=\"http://www.nerc.ac.uk\">Natural Environment Research Council, UK </a>.\n\n\nAbstract:\nProject Leatherback Ocean Wanderer uses satellite telemetry to gain insights into the behaviour of female leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) nesting at <a href=\"http://www.mayumbanationalpark.com\">Mayumba National Park</a> in Gabon, a globally important rookery. The project has now entered into its second year of tracking.

    "description": "Monthly microphytoplankton (~20 - 200 mm diameter fraction) samples were collected from Port Hacking 100m coastal station by hauling a 20 μm mesh net (245 mm diameter, 1.2 m length) with an attached 120 mL plastic jar (no flow meter) from a depth of 50 m from September 1998 to December 2009. Samples were preserved using 3% glutaraldehyde (final concentration) and stored at 4°C prior to microscopic examination.",

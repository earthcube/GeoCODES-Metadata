    "description": "Tracking of nine breeding Little shearwater (Puffinus assimilis haurakiensis) birds from Burgess Island, Mokohinau Group, Hauraki Gulf from Sept 2011 to Aug/Sept 2012. Equinox periods are filtered out for some birds and occasional days when unrealistic movements were present (probably caused by feathers shading the light sensor)\nData sourced from Zoatrack project 104 (https://zoatrack.org/projects/104/) on 2021-05-01",

    "description": "The ascidian, S. adareanum, from the Antarctic Peninsula near Anvers Island, is known to produce a bioactive compound, palmerolide A (PalA) that has specific activity to melanoma, a particularly invasive and metastatic form of skin cancer. The combined non-ribosomal peptide-polyketide structure of PalA has similarities to microbially-produced macrolides which motivated this study utilizing culture-dependent and -independent investigations coupled with PalA detection to improve our understanding of the host-associated microbiome and relationship to PalA. \n\nMicrobiome composition investigations were conducted to describe the microbiome structure and composition of the Antarctic ascidian, Synoicum adareanum.  Metadata sets include (1) ascidian sample collections (63 samples) from the Anvers Island archipelago and associated 16S rRNA gene Illumina tag sequence data sets (V3-V4); palmerolide chemistry data was determined for the same set of 63 samples, and is included with the metadata;(2) bacterioplankton sample collections (14 samples) from the Anvers Island archipelago and associated 16S rRNA gene Illumina tag sequence data sets (V3); (3) bacterial isolate 16S rRNA gene sequences (16 isolates, nearly full length 16S RNA gene), cultivated from Synoicum adareanum homogenates.",

    "description": "Original provider:\nUniversity of Exeter\n\nDataset credits:\nData provider\nMarine Turtle Research Group\nOriginating data center\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/\">Satellite Tracking and Analysis Tool (STAT)</a>\nProject partner\nThis project is a collaborative effort between the Gabon National Parks Agency, the Gabon Sea Turtle Partnership, the Wildlife Conservation Society and the Marine Turtle Research Group at the University of Exeter.\nProject sponsor or sponsor description\nThe project is generously funded by VAALCO Inc. and Harvest NR.\n\n\nAbstract:\nThe Gabon Sea Turtle Partnership has estimated that between 36,000 and 126,000 leatherback nests are laid on Gabonâ€™s beaches every year, about 50% of which occur in Mayumba National Park, and about 23% in Pongara National Park (Witt et al. 2009).  This degree of reproductive effort suggests that Gabon hosts the largest nesting population of leatherback turtles in the world, and approximately 60% of all nesting females in the entire Atlantic Ocean.The objectives of this satellite tracking project are:(a)\tDetermine the number of nests laid per season per female and the duration between each nesting event.(b)\tAssess the distance between successive nests during the season.(c)\tDevelop distribution maps of nesting and inter-nesting habitat use through high-resolution location data and diving behaviour data.(d)\tStudy the acoustic environment to which turtles are exposed at sea, through sound recording on the turtle.(e)\tEvaluate the effectiveness of current protection measures and propose management regimes tailored toward addressing the overlap between sea turtle distribution and behaviours and anthropogenic activities.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=776\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

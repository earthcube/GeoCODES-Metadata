    "description": "Original provider:\nHarbor Branch Oceanographic Institute, Florida Atlantic University\n\nDataset credits:\nSteve Burton, Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute, Florida Atlantic University\n\nAbstract:\nOur current five-year General Authorization (LOC #23069) for scientific research (Level B Harassment) to perform monthly vessel-based photo identification surveys of cetaceans in the IRL and the Atlantic Ocean from Sebastian Inlet to Jupiter Inlet, Florida. We propose to take a maximum of 700 bottlenose dolphins in the IRL annually. Offshore we propose a \nmaximum of 100 takes on bottlenose dolphins, 20 takes on pygmy sperm whales, 20 takes on humpback whales, 100 takes on pilot whales, 100 takes on Rissoâ€™s dolphins, 100 takes on Atlantic spotted dolphins, 100 takes on pantropical spotted dolphins, and 100 takes on rough-toothed dolphins annually. Research will occur year-round from 2021 through 2026.\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2023-01-31] 18 records in Jul-Oct 2022 were added.\n[2022-08-23] Three records in May 2022 were added.\n\nNew sightings will be added quarterly.",

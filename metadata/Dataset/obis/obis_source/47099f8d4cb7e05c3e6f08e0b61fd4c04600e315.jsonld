    "description": "Mollusca collected by Agassiz trawl from the 2016 SO-AntEco Expedition (JR15005) to the South Orkney Islands, Antarctica - data is an occurrence type dataset published by British Antarctic Survey.\nInformation regarding the Mollusca in this dataset is derived from Agassiz trawl (AGT) samples collected on shelf plateau and slope off the South Orkney Islands, Antarctica, within and outside of the South Orkney Islands Southern Shelf marine protected area. Sampling was conducted in the framework of the British Antarctic Survey/SCAR “South Orkneys - State of the Antarctic Ecosystem” (SO-AntEco) project aboard RRS James Clark Ross during expedition JR15005 in Austral summer 2016. Of 78 successful AGT deployments, 44 trawls at depths ranging from 235-2194 m contained living Mollusca, totaling 2276 individuals, 67  morphospecies and 163 distributional records. Of these, 1999 individuals were Bivalvia (accounting for 15 species), 158 Gastropoda (45 species), 113 Scaphopoda (2 species), 4 Polyplacophora (3 species) and 2 Aplacophora (2 species); empty shells  were also collected and recorded in the data table. Three morphospecies (1 Bivalvia and 2 Gastropoda) were collected exclusively as empty shells, thus yielding a total of 70 morphospecies represented in the dataset. All individuals were preserved in undenatured ethanol and are stored as vouchers in the collections of the British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, United Kingdom. This dataset constitutes a valuable contribution to the knowledge of megafaunal Mollusca associated with a range of benthic habitat types in the South Orkney Islands, an exceptionally diverse region of the Southern Ocean.\nThis dataset is published by British Antarctic Survey (BAS) under the license CC-BY 4.0.

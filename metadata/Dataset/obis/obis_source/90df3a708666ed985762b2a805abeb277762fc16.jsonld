    "description": "This resource contains species distribution records collected as part of a Marine Ecology Laboratory study on a mudflat ecosystem located at Pecks Cove in the Bay of Fundy.  This collection contains abundance (numbers per square meter) and distribution information for two benthic macroinvertebrates, the arthropod Corophium volutator and the mollusc Macoma balthica.\nThis OBIS resource contains a subset of the study results - for more information see Gordon et al 1980.",

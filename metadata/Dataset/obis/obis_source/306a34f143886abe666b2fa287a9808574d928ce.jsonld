    "description": "The Biotic Census of Cape Cod Bay was initiated in 1965 by the Systematics Ecology Program at the Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, Massachusetts. Completed in 1969, the census involved qualitative and quantitative sampling of the benthos to determine the species occurring in the bay, and to provide information about their ecology. This report is an account of the hydroids collected during the project.\n\nPresence information only is recorded. There are no abundance measurements.\n\nDistribution information associated with this study (Calder, 1975) was digitized, standardized and republished as part of the Atlantic Coastal Zone Information Steering Committee (ACZISC) Atlantic Ecosystem Initiative (AEI) funded project “Atlantic Canada’s Biological Data for Ecosystem Planning and Decision-making” and OBIS Canada.",

    "description": "Original provider:\nDalhousie University\n\nDataset credits:\nHal Whitehead, Department of Biology, Dalhousie University\n\nAbstract:\nThe Sargasso Sea cruise surveyed marine birds and mammals in the northeast Atlantic Ocean, during the summer of 2004. This survey, onboard the Valiant 40 ocean-going research vessel Balaena, consisted of two survey legs: a sail from Halifax, Nova Scotia to Beaufort, North Carolina (May 5 - 27), and a round trip from Beaufort, North Carolina to offshore waters north of the Bahamas (June 2 - 22). Sperm whales were surveyed during both legs by members of the Hal Whitehead laboratory.\n\nPurpose:\nThe purpose of this cruise was to study the behavior (principally social organization), ecology, and population biology of sperm whales. \n\nSupplemental information:\nThis dataset includes sperm whale sightings and survey effort. The effort data include sightings during surveys (on effort) and during focal follows of sperm whale schools (off effort). The survey track was recorded by logging a position every 10 minutes using the vessel's GPS.",

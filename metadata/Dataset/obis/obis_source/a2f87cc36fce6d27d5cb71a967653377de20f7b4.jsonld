    "description": "This is a historical dataset that forms part of the \"Report on the Danish Oceanographical Expeditions 1908-1910 to the Mediterranean and adjacent seas\". It includes data for the fish of the genus Lepadogaster sampled from several sites of the North Atlantic Ocean, near the English and French coasts and the Strait of Gibraltar during the years 1904-1910. The infromation extraction was based on the Table 1 of the publication and included abundance data and metadata of location, date, depth and the sampling effort. Additional information, such as the life stage, was extracted from the main text of the publication. The dataset was curated by the citizen scientists of the Zooniverse platform within the efforts of incorporating citizen science in the management of historical datasets of EMODnet Biology project. Standard quality control steps followed after this process.",

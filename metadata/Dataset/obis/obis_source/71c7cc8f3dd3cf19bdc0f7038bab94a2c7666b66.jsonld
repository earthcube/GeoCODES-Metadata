This year we have successfully attached seven satellite transmitters to green turtles nesting at Alagadi.The Marine Turtle Research Group has been conducting conservation research and protecting turtle nests in Northern Cyprus since 1992.  Alagadi Beach is the eighth largest rookery for green turtles in the Mediterranean, where they are highly endangered, and is also a major nesting beach for loggerhead turtles.  An intensive nocturnal monitoring programme allows us to identify each female that lays here and track her breeding success.  Wire screens are used to prevent predation of nests by feral dogs at Alagadi and at several other beaches on the North and West Coasts of Northern Cyprus.  Satellite tracking continues to be integral to our research, and helps to identify other areas of importance to these species.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=514\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

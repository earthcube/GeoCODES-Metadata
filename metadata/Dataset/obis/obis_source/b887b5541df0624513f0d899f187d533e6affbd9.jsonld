    "description": "The Windsor mudflat was formed by sediment accretion following the 1970 construction of the Windsor Causeway across the formerly tidal Avon River, in Nova Scotia, Canada. The Avon Estuary drains into the Minas Basin of the Bay of Fundy. The mudflat is situated between the causeway and the confluence of the Avon and St. Croix Rivers, centered at latitude 44o 59.75' North, longitude 64o 08.75' West (Canadian Hydrographic Service, 1994). \n\nThe portion of the mudflat used in this study lies on the eastern bank of the Avon River, approximately 400 m north of the east end of the Windsor Causeway and about 180 m northwest of the Windsor Tourist Bureau. At the time of the study (January to June, 1996), the study site extended northwest 78 m from the edge of the saltmarsh to the edge of the wastewater-outfall channel and straddled two parallel drainage channels, approximately 60 m apart, which extend perpendicularly from the saltmarsh to the sewage outfall channel. \n\nTo determine the distribution and abundance of macroinvertebrates at the study site, random sampling was conducted during an ice-free period in February. Once most of the ice had disappeared in mid-March, the study area was sampled weekly for 12 weeks, to monitor the spring recolonization of the mudflat. A systematic sample design was used, to minimize disturbance of the soft sediment during repeated weekly visits. In addition, a few samples of sediment and ice were collected at ice-free spots early in the study, in order to explore sediment conditions and invertebrate abundance during the period of ice cover.",

    "description": "The world is filled with nature watchers, from trampers to hunters, birders to beach-combers, and pros to school kids. Many of us keep notes of what we find. What if all those observations could be shared online? You might learn about the butterflies that live in your neighbourhood, or discover someone who knows all about the plants in your favourite reserve. For a long time, everyone's notes have been scattered in notebooks, private spreadsheets and dusty library shelves. As a society, we have seen a lot but collectively we remain blind to most changes in our biodiversity. If enough people record their observations on NatureWatch NZ, we can change all this. We can build a living record of life in New Zealand that scientists and environmental managers can use to monitor changes in biodiversity, and that anyone can use to learn more about New Zealand's amazing natural history.\nOnly \"research-quality\" observations are used in this data set - that is observations that have their species identification peer-reviewed by at least one independent source. All biodiversity observations are available at http://naturewatch.org.nz/.\nNatureWatch NZ is run by the New Zealand Bio-Recording Network Trust, a charitable trust dedicated to bio-recording. Our lofty aims are: (1) To increase knowledge, understanding, and appreciation of New Zealand's natural history.(2) To engage and assist New Zealanders in observing and recording biological information.(3)To develop and support online tools to assist individuals and groups to record, view, share and use biological information. (4) To collaborate with people and groups interested in bio-recording. (5) To promote and provide secure, open, and ethical sources of biological information for the public.",

Please contact tracking@seaturtle.org if you are interested in sponsoring one or more satellite tracked turtles from the North Carolina Rehabilitated Sea Turtle Monitoring Project\n\n\nAbstract:\nSince 1997, the Karen Beasley Sea Turtle Rescue and Rehabilitation Center, located on Topsail Island in North Carolina, has worked towards caring for sick or injured sea turtles in order that they should be released back to the wild. Each year, the KBSTRRC admits dozens of turtles that have been found in North Carolina and elsewhere. Working in collaboration with the wildlife veterinarians from North Carolina State University and others, the staff of the KBSTRRC have successfully rehabilitated and released more than 100 sea turtles over the past 7 years. The majority of turtles that have been released have been juveniles, and up until now there was no information available on where and how the turtles were going in the water. Now, with the help of satellite tracking, we can watch where some of the rehabilitated turtles go after their treatment at the KBSTRRC.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=444\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

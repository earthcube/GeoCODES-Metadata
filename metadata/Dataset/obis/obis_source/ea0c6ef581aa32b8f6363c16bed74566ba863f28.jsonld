    "description": "The Western Australian Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC) Seabird Island Database includes all available literature records since the publication of The Handbook of Australian Seabirds (Serventy et al. 1971) (plus selected references prior to that date), data from our own and colleagues' field note books, data from the Birds Australia Nest Records Scheme (up to 1985) and information provided by scientists and naturalists via a Seabird Breeding Islands Database Form. The Database is designed to be used by conservation managers, scientists and naturalists and depends on the contributions of interested people.",

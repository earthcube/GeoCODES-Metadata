    "description": "The data is the percent algal cover derived from underwater visual census methods involving transect counts at rocky reef sites around Tasmania. This data forms part of a larger dataset that also surveyed fish and megafaunal invertebrate abundance for the area. The aggregated dataset allows examination of changes in Tasmanian shallow reef floral and faunal communities over a decadal scale - initial surveys were conducted in 1992-1995, and again at the same sites in 2006-2007.\nThe originating metadata record http://metadata.imas.utas.edu.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/metadata.show?uuid=75fc95bf-e4b4-4d39-9ac3-0433669648de contains project details, additional contacts and on-line resources.",

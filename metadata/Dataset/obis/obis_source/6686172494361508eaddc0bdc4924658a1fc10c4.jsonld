    "description": "The data is the quantitative abundance of megafaunal invertebrates derived from underwater visual census methods involving transect counts at rocky reef sites around Tasmania. This data forms part of a larger dataset that also surveyed fish abundance and algal cover for the area. The aggregated dataset allows examination of changes in Tasmanian shallow reef floral and faunal communities over a decadal scale - initial surveys were conducted in 1992-1995, and again at the same sites in 2006-2007.\nThe originating metadata record http://metadata.imas.utas.edu.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/metadata.show?uuid=9aee213b-ab23-4321-9994-f7db2f6b2e78 contains project details, additional contacts and on-line resources.",

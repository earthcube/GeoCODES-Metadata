    "description": "The Inside South Hard Bottom Longline (HBLL) survey is one of a set of long-term and coordinated surveys that together cover most of the nearshore, hard-bottom habitat of coastal British Columbia. The other surveys are the Inside North HBLL survey, Outside South HBLL survey, and Outside North HBLL survey.\nThe Inside South HBLL survey was first conducted in 2005.  Starting in 2009, this survey has been repeated every second year in alternate years to the Inside North HBLL survey, with the exception that no surveys were conducted in 2017 and the 2020 survey was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The objective of these surveys is to provide fishery-independent abundance indices and associated biological data for the assessment of nearshore rockfishes and other groundfish species that live on untrawlable, hard bottom habitats. The surveys follow a random depth-stratified design and the sampling units are 2 km by 2 km blocks. The surveys use size 13/0 circle hooks, baited with frozen squid.\nThe Inside South HBLL Survey is conducted by Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) and takes place on the Canadian Coast Guard Research Vessel Neocaligus. This survey covers the southern portion of the inlets and protected waters east of Vancouver Island, including Desolation Sound, the Strait of Georgia and southern Gulf Islands in Pacific Fishery Management areas (PFMAs) 14 – 20, 28, and 29.\nThe data provided include information about the annual survey trips and fishing events (tows/sets) that are part of this survey series, including the vessel name, dates, times, spatial coverage, gear details, and effort information. Catch information (total weight in kg or counts of individual specimens) is included from successful fishing events. Catches are identified to species or to the lowest taxonomic level possible. Most catches are weighed, but some are too small (“trace” amounts) or too large (e.g. very large Big Skate). Some catches were subsampled and biological data were collected from individual fish specimens, including length, sex, and weight information. Where age structures were collected and processed, fish ages have been included.",

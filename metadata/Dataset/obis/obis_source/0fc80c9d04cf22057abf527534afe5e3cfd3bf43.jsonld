This stock of dolphin is taken in the tropical tuna fishery and has suffered a substantial decline. Previous surveys covering larger areas have permitted estimates of abundance, but with low precision. This survey was conducted by the NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center aboard NOAA Ships <i>David Starr Jordan</i> and <i>McArthur</i> for a combined total of approximately 32,000 kilometers surveyed from late July to early November 1992. This dataset provides the time-date and geographical coordinates, by species/stock, of all cetaceans detected during the survey, as well as the daily and intra-daily start and end points of the line-transect survey by the NOAA Ship <i>McArthur</i>.\n\nPurpose:\nThe primary purpose of the cruise was to survey the area inhabited by the central stock of common dolphins, and to make an estimate of its absolute abundance in order to assess the impact of the dolphins killed by the United States and international yellowfin tuna purse seine fleet in the eastern tropical Pacific.\n\nSupplemental information:\nThis dataset is supplemental to the following datasets: \nSWFSC Marine Mammal Survey, PODS 1992, Cruise 1468\nSWFSC Marine Mammal Survey, PODS 1993, Cruise 1508\nSWFSC Marine Mammal Survey, PODS 1993, Cruise 1509\nSWFSC Marine Mammal Survey, Delphinus 2009, Cruise 1640",

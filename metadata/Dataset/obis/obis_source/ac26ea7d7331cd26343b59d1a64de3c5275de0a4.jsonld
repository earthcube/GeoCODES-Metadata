Work was performed under HDR task order KB23 (IDIQ contract award N62470-10-D-3011, NAVFAC LANT).\n\nSupplemental information:\nSurvey station locations are available as a static layer.\n\nOne sighting of Melon-headed whale on 2015-03-12 13:36:50 (144.993618, 13.459862) was far from the shore stations and deleted by OBIS-SEAMAP.",

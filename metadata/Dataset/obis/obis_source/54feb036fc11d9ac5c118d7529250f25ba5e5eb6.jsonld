    "description": "Original provider:\nInstitute for Marine Mammal Studies\n\nDataset credits:\nData provider\nInstitute for Marine Mammal Studies\nOriginating data center\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/\">Satellite Tracking and Analysis Tool (STAT)</a>\n\n\nAbstract:\nTurtles are an important component of the ecosystem, and may serve as a key biological indicator of the health of their environments. They are constantly impacted by a variety of both natural and anthropogenic factors.Satellite telemetry is a powerful tool for examining short- and long-term movements of these protected species and enhancing conservation and management efforts. These observations will allow us to examine how much time these turtles actually spend in the Mississippi Sound and what microhabitats they utilize. The use of satellite tags on recently rehabilitated and released sea turtles will increase our knowledge about the daily activities and habitat fidelity of these animals.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=748\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

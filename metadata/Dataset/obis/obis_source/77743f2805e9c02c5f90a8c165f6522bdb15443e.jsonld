    "description": "It is widely recognized that wide areas of the Arctic are changing from arctic to subarctic conditions. Rapid warming is causing higher water temperatures and reduced ice cover, two factors that will certainly provoke severe ecosystem changes propagating through all trophic levels. At this stage, it is essential to establish benchmarks in biodiversity at key locations in the Canadian Arctic prior to (a) the expected changes in ice cover, ocean chemistry and climate and (b) the future human activities (transport, trawling or dredging, fossil fuel, etc.) that are likely to happen in response to the predicted environmental changes. Unlike Canadaâ€™s two other oceans, we have the opportunity to document pristine conditions before ocean changes and exploitation occurs. This could help sound management actions in the Arctic.",

    "description": "\"Stable isotope ratios and elemental contents of C, N and S in benthic organisms sampled during the PROTEKER 5 summer campaign in Kerguelen Islands (2016)\" is sampling event type dataset published by SCAR-AntOBIS. The report of the summer campaign (in french) is available at: https://proteker.osupytheas.fr/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PROTEKER2016-17_rapport_xs.pdf \n\n\nThis dataset contains records of 363 specimens from 29 taxa, based on SCUBA diving collection complemented with intertidal collections on the shore and in rock pools at low tide during the PROTEKER 5 campaign in Kerguelen Islands from 03/11/2016 to 31/12/2016. \n\nThe data is published as a standardized Darwin Core Archive and includes for each sampling event an eventID, date, time, location, depth range, sampling protocol (in the event core). For each occurrence, an occurrenceID, eventID, status (present/absent), catalog number, institution code, scientific name, taxa classification, preparations are specified in the occurrence extension. Each measurement associated with a sampling event or an occurrence record will have a measurementID, measurement type, measurement value and measurement unit and their corresponding identifiers if any (in the extended measurement or fact extension). \n\nThis dataset is published by SCAR-AntOBIS under the license CC-BY 4.0. We would appreciate it if you could follow the guidelines from the SCAR and IPY Data Policies (https://www.scar.org/excom-meetings/xxxi-scar-delegates-2010-buenos-aires-argentina/4563-scar-xxxi-ip04b-scar-data-policy/file/) when using the data.

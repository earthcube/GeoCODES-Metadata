    "description": "This record describes an aggregated data product compiled from a number of different surveys of Macrocystis surface cover in Tasmanian waters, spanning 1950 to 2019. Some surveys represent a statewide census of Macrocystis cover, while others are targeted surveys of smaller regions. Methodology and data quality also varies between surveys. Please see linked metadata records for specific methodologies and quality statements applying to individual surveys.\nCompiled by Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS), University of Tasmania (UTAS).

    "description": "In 1998, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission's (FWC) Fisheries Independent Monitoring (FIM) program began a long-term monitoring effort of key reef fish populations in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. This effort was aimed at evaluating the relative abundance, size structure, and habitat utilization of specific reef fish species that are targeted by commercial and recreational fisheries.",

    "description": "A historical dataset, by Edward Forbes, Professor of Botany in King's College, London. This digitised report, requested by the British Association, refers to the Mollusca and Radiata inhabiting the Aegean and the Red Sea. The data upon which this report is founded have been entirely derived from a voyage of 18 months to the Aegean. The calculations have been based upon more than 100 fully recorded dredging operations in various depths and in many localities. The digitization process concerns the Appendix of the Report, which refers to the Examples of Dredging Papers, selected in order to show the associations of species in several regions. The numerous dredging operations on which this Report is founded were all registered in a similar manner. ",

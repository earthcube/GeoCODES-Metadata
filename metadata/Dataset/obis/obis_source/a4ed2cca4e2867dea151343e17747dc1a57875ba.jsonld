    "description": "Original provider:\nWWF Indonesia\n\nDataset credits:\nData provider\nUdayana University - WWF Joint Program\nOriginating data center\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/\">Satellite Tracking and Analysis Tool (STAT)</a>\n\n\nAbstract:\nTo support establishment of turtle protected area network within the Sulu-Sulawesi Marine Ecoregion, WWF Coral Triangle Turtle Program has sponsored the satellite tagging of two green turtles on Sangalaki Island. The Berau Archipelago, of wich Derawan is the most populated Island, is located off Kalimantan's N-E coast. It is home to one the country's major green turtle rookeries (with Sangalaki Island as undisputed nesting hotspot). It is hoped that, aside the scientific significance of the project, this initiative will pave the way for a durable support of local communities towards sea turtle conservation.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=234\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

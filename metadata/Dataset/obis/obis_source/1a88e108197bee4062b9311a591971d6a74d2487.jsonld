    "description": "Seabird observations were conducted in the Coral Sea from the Schmidt Ocean Institute vessel RV Falkor, Voyage FK201228  from late December 2020 to January 2021. The  voyage 'Pinging in the New Year: Mapping the Tasman and Coral Seas' was a month long investigation in the Tasman and Coral seas to conduct uninterrupted, broad-scale seafloor mapping, and to observe the concentration of seabirds in the area. At-sea seabird observation data were collected using standard protocols to establish baselines in the region and to better understand species distribution over space and time, which is often influenced by seafloor features and ocean productivity.\nTime aboard R/V Falkor for data collection on cruise number  FK201228 was granted by Schmidt Ocean Institute (https://schmidtocean.org).",

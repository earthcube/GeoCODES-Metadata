    "description": "This dataset includes species found in the demosponge Sarcotragus foetidus. The sponges were collected form two stations, in depths between 5 and 17 meters. The stations were located in Linaraki (Sithonia, Halkidiki, Greece) and in Milourgia (Kissonerga, Pafos, Cyprus). Sampling in Cyprus was conducted in January of 2003 and August of 2003 and 2007, in depths between 5 and 10 meters. Sampling in Greece was conducted in February and July of 2003, in depths between 14 and 17 meters.",

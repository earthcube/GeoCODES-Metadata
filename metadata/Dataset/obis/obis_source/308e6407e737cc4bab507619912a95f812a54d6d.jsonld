    "name": "Zooplankton samples from Heron net trawls along the 110°E meridian, eastern Indian Ocean, RV Investigator voyage IN2019_V03 (2019)",
    "description": "A Heron net (60 cm diameter, 100 μm mesh, drop net; (Heron, 1982) was used to sample zooplankton to a depth of 100 m at 20 stations equally spaced at 1.5o of latitude along the 110°E transect, from station 1 at 39.5oS to station 20 at 11.5oS. The Heron net samples on the downward drop and the net is closed when tension is applied to the line. The net falls at 1 ms-1 and so after 100 seconds, which is ~100 m, the line was stopped from free-flowing and the net retrieved. The net is closed and is not sampling on the upward haul.",

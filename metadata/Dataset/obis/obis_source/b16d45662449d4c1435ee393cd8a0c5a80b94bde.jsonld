    "description": "Original provider:\nKate Stafford, University of Washington\n\nDataset credits:\nKate Stafford, University of Washington\n\nAbstract:\nPassive acoustic data were collected from a mooring deployed at 71.412 N 152.0065 W in the Beaufort Sea. Sounds of bowhead and beluga whales and bearded seals were recorded seasonally. Bowhead and beluga whale sounds occurred in the fall, spring and summer. Bearded seals were recorded primarily in the winter.\n\nPurpose:\nThese data were collected as part of an interdisciplinary project to monitor the influence of the western Arctic boundary current on the ecosystem of the Beaufort Sea shelf. Hydrophones were deployed along side an oceanographic mooring measuring current speed and direction, temperature, salinity and ice cover to determine what, if any, of these physical parameters influence the presence of vocal Arctic marine mammals including bowhead and beluga whales and bearded seals.\n\nSupplemental information:\nAcoustic monitoring was on during the first 15 minutes of every hour starting on 9/25/2010 and ended on 8/29/2011. Each record represents presence of the species.\n\nhydrophone deployed: Multi-electronique Aural M2\n\nSampling frequency: 16384 Hz",

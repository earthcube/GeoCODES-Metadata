    "description": "All surveys were carried out by the principal researcher using Rapid Ecological Assessment. The dataset comprises 41 sites.\n\nEach site was surveyed with up to 5 transects (usually 200-300m long, 1-3m wide for 10-15 minutes) at pre-defined depths (1-3m, 3-8m, 8-13m, 13-18m and reef flat).\n\nSpecies recorded: octocorals (soft corals, gorgonians, sea fans, sea whips, sea pens, leather corals, arborescent octocorals, blue coral, stoloniferans), black and wire coral. Note that taxa were recorded mostly at generic level.\nTaxa have been matched to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS). This dataset was sourced on July 2018 from the original DiGIR dataset at OBIS and updated to reflect changes in the OBIS data requirements.",

Muscat Branch.\n\n\nAbstract:\nLoggerhead nesting on Masirah Island, Oman, was first studied in depth in the late 1970s. It was estimated that around 30,000 female turtles came to nest each year on its beaches making it one of the largest, if not the largest loggerhead nesting populations in the world.Since the early studies monitoring and conservation efforts have been undertaken by hard-working local rangers.In 2005 a three year project to assess and evaluate sea turtle populations in Masirah Island as well as establish a sustainable, general management plan for the Island and surrounding areas (Barr Al-Hikman and the Islands in the Masirah Channel) was initiated. One of the focal activities in 2006 is to track 10 nesting females to their possibly remote foraging areas as many years of flipper tagging have so far revealed very little of their migratory behaviour.A second project, with a further 10 transmitters will be undertaken in August by the Environment Society of Oman. Combining the information will strengthen the findings for appropriate conservation measures.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=145\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

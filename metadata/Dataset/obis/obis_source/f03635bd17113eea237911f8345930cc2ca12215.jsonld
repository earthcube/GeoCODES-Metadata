    "description": "Original provider:\nMarijke de Boer\n\nDataset credits:\nMarijke N. de Boer\n\nAbstract:\nWe recorded birds in the waters off Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire during two surveys, totalling 104 days, in April–May 2013 and March–May 2014. Several species were observed for which there are few or no previous records for either country, with Sooty Shearwater Ardenna grisea and Cory’s Shearwater Calonectris borealis being new for Ghana, and Leach’s Storm-petrel Hydrobates leucorhous, White-tailed Tropicbird Phaethon lepturus, Cory’s Shearwater and Long-tailed Skua Stercorarius longicaudus for Côte d’Ivoire. Our sightings suggest that several seabird species considered vagrants or rare visitors may occur more frequently in Ghanaian and Ivorian waters than previously thought.\n\nPurpose:\nThe main purpose of this study was to contribute information on the distribution and occurrence of seabirds sighted during two geophysical surveys off Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire.",

    "description": "From 1975 to 2000, biological surveys were undertaken of the many islands around the coast of Tasmania and Bass Strait. Most sites were visited only once. There were varying methods to estimate the population size of the seabirds at each site, ranging from counting active nests, burrows and in some cases from the size of the site along with a measure of the nest or burrow densities.\nFurther details of the geology and vegetation cover are in the cited reference Brothers, Nigel, Pemberton, David, Pryor, Helen and Halley, Vanessa (2001) Tasmania's offshore islands: seabirds and other natural features.

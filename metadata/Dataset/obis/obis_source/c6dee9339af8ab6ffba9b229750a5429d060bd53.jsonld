    "description": "A Rapid Assessment Survey (RAS) is conducted by a team of marine species experts to identify both native and introduced species found at selected sites. The goal of an RAS is to make a quick assessment of introduced species present and use this information to document their distribution and collect environmental data. Surveys were conducted in 2000, 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2010.",

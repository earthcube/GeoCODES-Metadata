    "description": "Original provider:\nMarine Ecology and Telemetry Research\n\nDataset credits:\nMarine Ecology and Telemetry Research\n\nAbstract:\nThe United States (US) Navy uses the Southern California (SOCAL) portion of \nthe Hawaii-Southern California Training and Testing area, a collection of \nnearshore and offshore training areas that include much of the navigable \nwater from Santa Barbara Island, California, to northern Baja California, \nMexico, and extending several hundred miles to the west. It is among one of \nthe most heavily used tactical training areas in the world, and is used for a \nvariety of aerial, surface, and subsurface exercises. The Southern California \nOffshore Range (SCORE) is a subset of complexes within SOCAL centered on \nSan Clemente Island and managed via the Range Operation Center (ROC) on \nNorth Island, Coronado. It includes the Southern California Anti-submarine \nWarfare Range (SOAR), a focal area for exercises involving mid-frequency \nactive sonar (MFAS) systems within the San Nicolas Basin.\n\nThrough its N45 Living Marine Resources (LMR) research programs, and more \nrecently in support of Pacific Fleet Monitoring efforts, the US Navy has funded \ndirected studies on cetacean occurrence on SOAR since 2006. The primary \nfocus of these studies is to support long-term surveys of Cuvierâ€™s beaked \nwhales and fin whales using photo-identification (photo-ID) and genetics to \nelucidate population size, structure, and trends, which can in turn provide a \nparticularly robust basis for assessing population-level impacts of Navy \ntraining. Data is collected on all species encountered in this region as part of \nthe monitoring program.\n\nPurpose:\nData from this project is collected to better understand the movement and \nhabitat use of cetaceans within and around the Southern California Bight (SCB). \nThe SCB is home to a diverse group of cetacean species, and is an area of \nsignificant human impacts, including commercial shipping, Navy training, and \nrecreational boating.\n\nSupplemental information:\nThese surveys were funded by Fleet for Southern California.",

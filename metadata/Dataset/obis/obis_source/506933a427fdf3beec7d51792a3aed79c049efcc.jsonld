    "description": "Original provider:\nQueens Beach Action Group\n\nDataset credits:\nData provider\nApudthama flatback turtle project\nOriginating data center\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/\">Satellite Tracking and Analysis Tool (STAT)</a>\nProject partner\nThe project is supported by Queens Beach Action Group, North Queensland Bulk Ports Corporation, Gudjuda Rangers, Queensland Parks &amp; Wildlife, Juru Traditional Owners, Bowen Primary School, and James Cook University.\nProject sponsor or sponsor description\nNorth Queensland Bulk Ports is sponsoring an innovative turtle monitoring program through the Queens Beach Action Group (QBAG) in Bowen. This sponsorship will allow the behaviour of turtles to be monitored via satellite from a transponder attached to a turtle.\n\n\nAbstract:\nBowen, Queensland Australia is a well known feeding area for marine turtles.  Six of the world's seven species of marine turtles are found off the coast of North Queensland.  Despite this, there is a lack of community awareness and understanding of the issues impacting on these great mariners. This project aims to demonstrate, through a satellite tracking device what the day-to-day life is for a male green turtle in the lead up to the breeding season.  Walnut is an adult male green turtle who weighs ~150kg and was found feeding in Edgcumbe Bay. Walnut had his transmitter attached and was released into Edgecumbe Bay on the 23rd September 2013. September in Queensland is the lead-up to the approaching nesting season and a time of the year when male green turtles are looking for a partner.  This study hopes to find out what sort of an area a male turtle will cover looking for females who are also preparing to breed.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=922\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

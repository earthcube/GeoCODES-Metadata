    "description": "Evidence of a Vulnerable Marine Ecosystem documented via tourist submarine off Cape Well-Met, Vega Island, Eastern Antarctic Peninsula (Subarea 48.1) - data is a sampling event type dataset published by AntOBIS.\n\nThis dataset contains records of taxonomic groups that are considered VME-IT by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Resources (CCAMLR) and their relative percent abundances compared to non-VME-IT and bare substrate based on footage taken with a GoPro Hero 7 Black mounted in the pilot window of a U-Boat Worx Cruise Sub 7-300 during an MY Scenic Eclipse citizen tourist cruise at Cape Well-Met, Vega Island, Antarctica on 29 November 2019. The data is published as a standardized Darwin Core Archive and includes locality, coordinates, event date, depth, sampling protocol, sampling effort, occurrence status, vernacular name, scientific name and taxa classification.

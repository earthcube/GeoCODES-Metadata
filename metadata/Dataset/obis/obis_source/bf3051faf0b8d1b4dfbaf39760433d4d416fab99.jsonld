    "description": "In 1997 and 1998 soft-bottom fauna of the arctic glacial fjord Kongsfjorden was extensively sampled and major communities were identified along the fjord axis, which were believed to be related to the diminishing influence of the glacial activity. This set of data was collected as part of a PhD programme and was the result of repeated sampling in search for natural or climate driven community changes.",

    "description": "Original provider:\nIsrael Marine Mammal Research and Assistance Center (IMMRAC)\n\nDataset credits:\nNir Hadar, Oz Goffman, Aviad Scheinin and Dani Kerem, Israel Marine Mammal Research and Assistance Center (IMMRAC)\n\nAbstract:\nIMMRAC is a purely voluntary registered nonprofit organization dedicated to the conservation of cetacean populations in the Eastern Mediterranean and in the noethern Red Sea, through scientific research and public education. IMMRAC is a partner of ACCOBAMS. Research activities are under the academic auspices of the Institute for Maritime Studies, School of Marine Sciences in the University of Haifa. Open Sea research activity along the 190 km-long Israeli Mediterranean coast is conducted throughout the year, weather permitting. It focuses on the socio-ecology of the resident bottlenose dolphin population through half-day surveys from inflatable boats and private yachts. Due to logistic reasons, open sea research in the Red Sea is opportunistic and sporadic.\n\nPurpose:\nIMMRAC collates shore-based and boat-based cetacean sightings, the latter from dedicated surveys as well as from platforms of opportunity, made by its own staff or reported to it by other parties. The latter are mostly backed by photographs/videos or else, are indisputably accredited through careful interrogation by IMMRAC experts in real time and/or soon after the sighting, aided by a pictorial guide.\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2014-03-27] Sightings in 2012-2014 were appended. The activity column was added in this period whereas the seastate and comments columns were not provided.\n\nSome records had estimates, minimums, or ranges for group sizes - these were converted to numbers, minimum + 1, or the median number (rounded down), respectively, for the number of animals observed.",

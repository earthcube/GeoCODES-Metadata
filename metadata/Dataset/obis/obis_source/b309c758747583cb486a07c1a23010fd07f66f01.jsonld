    "description": "Original provider:\nDuke University Marine Laboratory\n\nDataset credits:\nDuke University Marine Laboratory\n\nAbstract:\nA multi-institutional, marine protected species monitoring program, involving aerial, vessel and acoustic surveillance techniques, has been implemented at the proposed Under Sea Warfare Training Range (USWTR) offshore of Jacksonville, Florida, United States to investigate cetacean and sea turtle species occurrence, distribution. Ten 87 km track-lines spaced 6.5 km apart transect the 1,295 km2 USWTR box, which is located between 60 and 150 km offshore.\n\nPurpose:\nConduct surveys and passive acoustic deployments in two proposed USWTRs on the east coast of the United States with the aim to document patterns of distribution and seasonal residency of protected species.\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2020-09-30] The following invalid species names were corrected according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS).\nTurtles: Testudines (173749) =&gt; Testudines (948936)\n\n2013-04-08: Sighting data from March 1, 2010 through March 19, 2011 were appended.\nTwo species identifications in the previous sightings were corrected:\n01/13/10 14:51:08 Stenella sp =&gt; Unid. delphinid\n01/28/10 14:16:14 T. truncatus =&gt; Stenella frontalis\n\n2013-03-19: Additional survey data for the JAX USWTR site (conducted with different survey methods from this dataset) are available on OBIS-SEAMAP in <a href=\"http://seamap.env.duke.edu/datasets/detail/906\">DUML vessel-based photo-id and biopsy surveys for proposed JAX USWTR site 2012-2013</a>.",

    "description": "Original provider:\nHDR Environmental, Operations and Construction, Inc.\n\nDataset credits:\nThe U.S. Navy Marine Species Monitoring Program\n\nAbstract:\nFeatures in this feature class represent animal sightings recorded during a 10-day shore-based marine mammal survey in the Mariana Islands. Observations were conducted from two separate vantage points, both located on Andersen Air Force Base on the northeast coast of Guam. Survey dates were 11-20 May 2013. Work was performed under HDR task order KB23 (IDIQ contract award N62470-10-D-3011, NAVFAC LANT). There are two discrepancies between the sighting totals in the KB23 Guam Shore Station Feasibility report and this GIS dataseta. First, there is one unidentified cetacean sighting (5/18/2013 10:26:38AM) in the GIS data that was inadvertantly omitted in the report. Second, due to a typo, the longitude for the Unid Hardshell turtle sighting on 5/14/2013 11:30:00 AM is incorrectly listed in the report. It has been corrected in the GIS data and maps.",

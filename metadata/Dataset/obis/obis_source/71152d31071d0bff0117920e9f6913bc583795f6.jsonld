    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nNOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC)\n\nAbstract:\nDuring 14 August 2016–28 September 2016 the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) conducted an aerial abundance survey targeting marine mammals and sea turtles. The southwestern extent was New Jersey and the northeastern extent was the southern tip of Nova Scotia, Canada. This survey covered waters from the coast line to about the 100m depth contour (summer). The summer survey coordinated with another aerial survey south of this study area in US waters and north of this area in Canadian waters, along with shipboard surveys which covered waters deeper than 100 m. Track lines were flown 183 m (600 ft) above the water surface, at about 200 kph (110 knots), and the two-independent team methodology was used to collect data. In Beaufort sea states of five and less, during the summer about 11,782 km of on-effort track lines were accomplished, where 95% of this effort was in Beaufort 3 and below.\n\nPurpose:\nThe objectives of these aerial flights were to collect the data needed to estimate abundance of cetaceans and turtles in the study area and to investigate how the animals’ distribution and abundance relate to their physical and biological ecosystem.\n\nSupplemental information:\nPerpendicular distance to the animal is not publicly available.

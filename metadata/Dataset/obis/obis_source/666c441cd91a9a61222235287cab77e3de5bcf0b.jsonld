The project aims to examine size-based foraging patterns of turtles.  These movement data will be integrated with a charaterization of the local habitat and an assessment of anthropogenic threats.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=475\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

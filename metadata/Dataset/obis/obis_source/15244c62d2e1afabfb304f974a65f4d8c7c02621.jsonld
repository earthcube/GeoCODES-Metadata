    "description": "This report is based on the collections of specimens and data in the Auckland and Campbell Islands in the years 1941-45. Early in 1941, coast-watching stations were established at Port Ross, Carnley Harbour, and Perseverance Harbour, and the personnel of from three to five men at each were relieved once a year. Standing instructions issued by the Navy Office included a recommendation that the men should, in addition to service routine, record general observations on natural phenomena. This report is regarded as of the Cape Expedition which was the war-time code name for parties in the field between 1941 and 1945. \nPrior to the Cape Expedition, the accounts of the ascidians of the Auckland and Campbell Islands appear in the papers from Dr. Th. Mortensen's Pacific Expedition (Bovien, 1921, amd Michaelsen, 1922, 1924). The ascidians collected by Mr. W. H. Dawbin during the Cape Expedition were all from the Auckland Islands.",

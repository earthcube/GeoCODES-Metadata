    "description": "These data were collected to trial passive eDNA collection methods in tropical and temperate waters for the detection of fishes. The data were generated as part of a feasibility study within the Environomics Future Science Platform. The goal of the project was to develop low-cost, low-tech, easy to deploy methods for biomonitoring studies.",

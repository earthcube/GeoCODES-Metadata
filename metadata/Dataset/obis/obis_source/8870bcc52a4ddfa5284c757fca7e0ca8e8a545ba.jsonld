    "description": "Original provider:\nWWF Indonesia\n\nDataset credits:\nData provider\nUdayana University - WWF Joint Program\nOriginating data center\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/\">Satellite Tracking and Analysis Tool (STAT)</a>\n\n\nAbstract:\nThe beaches along the coast of South-West Sumbawa, historically had been known as significant nesting sites for at least three species of marine turtles, namely the Green turtle, Hawksbill, and the Olive Ridley turtle. Despite of the beauty and the intactness of the coastal areas, all species of turtle populations have undergone a dramatic decline due to massive eggs collection for local consumption. In the past, this area was also one of the traditional catching sites for turtle hunters who eventually sold them for Bali market. This post-nesting turtle migration study is conducted by WWF Indonesia and WWF Denmark in collaboration with the Regional Nature Conservation Agency of West Nusa Tenggara and PT NNT (a mining company operates in this area), to raise awareness among the local community, local government, as well as private sectors in the area. The awareness is not only necessary to reverse the declining trend of turtle population, but also to turtleï¿½s resilience to the effects of climate change and give them the best possible chance of survival into the future by means of encouraging the locals to protect their known nesting and foraging habitats.This project is part of a larger program build within the Coral Triangle Region to determine the migration routes of turtle population that is vital for establishing a network of turtle protected area.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=266\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

    "description": "This dataset contains data of the occurrence of seagrass species which was recorded at the Monitoring Sites 1000 Projects: Coastal Area Survey (Seagrass beds). The annual survey was carried out with six places of Japanese coast from north (Hokkaido) to south (Okinawa). In addition, the data about reference specimens (seagrass and macrozoobenthos) in the survey every five years is included. The data of this dataset is derived from the data file of the Monitoring Sites 1000 Projects: Coastal Area Survey. The data file includes the information about quantity data of seagrass (a cover degree, biomass).",

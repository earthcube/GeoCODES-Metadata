    "description": "This resource contains results from a preliminary study designed to produce a preliminary survey of zooplankton distribution and to create a regional, summer-time reconaissance of the zooplankton potentially affected by tidal power development. (Hildebrand 1981).\nThis resource contains observations at two fixed geographic stations at the south of Shepody Bay in the Bay of Fundy in June 1978. Abundance information is not provided but it is noted if the taxa were rare, common or abundant in the samples collected using plankton ring nets. The objective of the sampling was to examine temporal changes in zooplankton composition over complete tidal cycles.",

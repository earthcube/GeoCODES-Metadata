    "description": "This study surveyed fish communities associated with two large patches of coastal reef that had been mapped previously using high-resolution multibeam acoustics. The reefs at Butlers Point and the Friars, located on the east and south coasts of Tasmania, are the focus of important commercial and recreational fisheries. The surveys utilised underwater video methods, including baited remote underwater video (BRUV) and remotely operated vehicle (ROV), as well as gillnets. Patterns in community composition, interactions between species and relationships with reef characteristics were described using multivariate statistical analyses. This information was assessed for its utility to develop predictive distribution and abundance maps of key species.\nMetadata and data from GlobalArchive (https://globalarchive.org/geodata/data/project/get/133) accessed in 2021-08-31",

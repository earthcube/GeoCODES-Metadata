    "description": "In 1947 the Fisheries Research Board of Canada (FRB) initiated the Eastern Arctic Investigations. These were seasonal marine biological investigations led by Prof. M.J. Dunbar from McGill University, Montreal, Quebec. The name \"Calanus\" comes from the name of the 50-foot wooden diesel ketch used during the program. The \"Calanus\" Series consists of collected reprints of publications resulting directly from the vessel's program in the eastern Canadian arctic.",

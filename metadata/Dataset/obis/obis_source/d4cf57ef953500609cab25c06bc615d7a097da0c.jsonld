    "description": "A new species of rock lobster, Jasus caveorum, is described from commercial catches taken on a non-emergent seamount in the eastern South Pacific Ocean. The species best fits the \"frontalis subgroup\" of the \"lalandii group\" of\nJasus lobsters. J. caveorum is most similar to J. frontalis from the eastern South Pacific, but differs clearly from that species in having very little\nabdominal \"squamous\" sculpturing.",

    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nNOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC)\n\nAbstract:\nSoutheast Cetacean Aerial Survey, SECAS, was conducted in 1995 by NOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) to estimate cetacean abundance. This data set contains sightings of cetaceans and sea turtles as well as other species, including fish and shark, observed during the aerial survey.\nThe full taxonomic information for this dataset can be found in the Species tab. Marine mammals and sea turtles observed  were:\nCetaceans:\n- Atlantic spotted dolphin\n- Cuvierâ€™s beaked whale\n- Humpback whale\n- Northern right whale\n- Pantropical spotted dolphin\n- Standard Bottlenose dolphin\n- Striped dolphin\n\nSea Turtles:\n- Green turtle\n- Hardshell\n- Kemp's ridley\n- Leatherback\n- Loggerhead\n\nThis survey's transects are available in the 'SECAS95Efforts' table/shapefile. ESRI coverage and shapefiles are available for this data set.\n\nPurpose:\nThe purpose of this data set was to collect cetacean distribution data and allow for estimating cetacean abundance in the southeast. These abundance estimates were expected to serve as a basis for estimating Potential Biological Removals (PBR) for the species stocks in the region in support of Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) requirements. More specifically, the survey was to obtain an index of abundance for <i>Tursiops truncatus</i> so as to detect population trends by comparison with historical abundance data (SETS).\n\nSupplemental information:\nRecords with no common name were observations of pollution (e.g., plastic).\nRecords were assigned a sequential number LineNo. LineNo can be used to match observations with corresponding transects, each of which has BegLineNo and EndLineNo fields. Observation records with their LineNo between BegLineNo and EndLineNo in a transect are related to  that transect.\nA duplicated LineNo indicates more than one species were observed at the same time.\nRecords include 'off-effort' sightings as well. Card F indicates that the observation was recorded while off-effort.\nWhen searching for a specific species, note that some records don't identify animals observed at a species level. If this is the case, the common/scientific name may be genus/family or higher (e.g., <i>Balaenoptera</i> sp.).\nA transect may consist of several segments when the aircraft goes off effort while on the transect.\nObservations associated with Transect 99 are not a part of the survey in a strict sense.",

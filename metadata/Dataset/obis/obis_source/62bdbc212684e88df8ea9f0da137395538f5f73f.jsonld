    "description": "Intertidal and subtidal surveys were conducted at 11 sites within the Bonaparte Archipelago at two platform reefs and five fringing reefs from September 16 to 21, 2016. Subtidal sites were surveyed on SCUBA at 12 m depth. Mid-to-lower littoral reef flats were surveyed by reef\nwalking at low tide. At each site, the percent cover of 12 categories of benthos (hard coral, soft coral, sponge, macroalgae, algal turf, coralline algae, calcareous algae, seagrass, other invertebrates, sand, rubble, rock and silt) was examined in situ along three 25-m point-intercept\ntransects (50 points per transect), which were laid in a series within the same depth range.\nData from cited paper Richards et al.

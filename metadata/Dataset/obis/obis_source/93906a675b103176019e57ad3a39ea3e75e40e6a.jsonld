The species is considered vulnerable to extinct.\n\n\nAbstract:\nBowen, Queensland Australia is a well known nesting site for sea turtles.  Six of the world's seven species of sea turtles are found off the coast of North Queensland.  Despite this, there is a lack of community awareness and understanding of the issues impacting on these great mariners. This project aims to demonstrate to the community through satellite tracking what the day-to-day lives are of two Flatback sea turtles.  How they feed, what distances they travel and where they might potential nest.Turtle one: Kindawry is a female Flatback turtle that came ashore to nest in mid November 2011.  Kindawry was named by a student from Bowen Primary School.  Kindawry is about 40 years old and she weights 90 kilograms. \n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=684\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

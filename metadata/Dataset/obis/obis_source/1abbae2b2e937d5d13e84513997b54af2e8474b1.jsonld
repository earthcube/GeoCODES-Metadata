The project is carried out by the division of Conservation Biology of the University of Berne (Switzerland) in collaboration with ARCHELON, the Sea Turtle Protection Society of Greece. Zakynthos is the largest known sea turtle nesting area of the Mediterranean, hosting about 1/4 of all known loggerhead nesting in the Mediterranean. The nesting beaches of Zakynthos are monitored by ARCHELON since 1983.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=1340\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

    "description": "This resource contains species distribution records associated with a study that examined coastal fish assemblages and the physical features of nearshore ecosystems with the objective of determining relationships between geophysical characteristics and biotic communities. Content from this study formed the basis of a university thesis for the degree of Master of Science (Biology). The thesis title was 'Relationships between Juvenile Fish Assemblages and the Physical Features of Bays along the Atlantic Coast of Mainland Nova Scotia, with Implications for Coastal Marine Protected Areas' (O'Connor 2008). Twenty bays were sampled for juvenile fish along the coast of mainland Nova Scotia, from Chedabucto Bay to the Bay of Fundy.  Using a beach seine, 19,505 individual fish, representing 35 unique species, were caught during two field seasons (June – October 2005, June – September 2006).",

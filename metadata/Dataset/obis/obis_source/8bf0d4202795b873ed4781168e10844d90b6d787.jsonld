    "description": "Original provider:\nMarijke de Boer\n\nDataset credits:\nMarijke de Boer\n\nAbstract:\nInformation on cetaceans in the Indian Ocean Sanctuary and the South China Sea is summarized from a cruise carried out from 29 March to 17 April 1999. Ten species were positively identified: finless porpoise, pantropical spotted dolphin, spinner dolphin, sperm whale, melon-headed whale, pygmy killer whale, false killer whale, Cuvier’s beaked whale, Bryde’s whale and fin whale. Spotted dolphins, melon-headed and pygmy killer whales were sighted around the Island of Borneo and sightings of fin whales and a sperm whale west of the Balabac Strait suggest a possible migration route of these species between the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea. This is the first record\nof fin whales in the South China Sea.\n\nPurpose:\nThis note details cetacean observations made during a cruise from Mauritius to the Philippines in April (ca 4,520 nautical miles).\n\nSupplemental information:\nTime was not provided, so it was filled with \"00:00:00.\"",

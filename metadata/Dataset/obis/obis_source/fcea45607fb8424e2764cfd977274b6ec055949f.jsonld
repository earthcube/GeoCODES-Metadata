    "description": "The Hakai Institute Oceanography Program has been monitoring surface (0-1 or 5m depth) protistan plankton community composition, via optical microscopy, at a fixed location in the northern Salish Sea (Strait of Georgia) since 2016. Data were collected to characterize and monitor phytoplankton community composition and investigate links to environmental/physical/chemical drivers, the food web and carbon dynamics. Additionally, data were used to support group level phytoplankton composition derived via HPLC phytoplankton pigment analysis and validate remote sensing products.   ",

    "description": "During July and early August, 1962, the H.M.N.Z.F.A. Tui undertook a deep-water research cruise in a broadly triangular area bounded by Auckland, Norfolk Island and the Kermadec Islands, an area which includes the southern half of the South Fiji Basin. As part of the biological programme of this cruise, trawls were made in midwater depths of yup to about 1,1000m with a 10ft Isaacs-Kidd trawl as well as on the surface and on the bottom with other gear. Collections were made with dipnets and handlines. In the large and diverse collection of fishes which resulted were some 43 eels and eel-larvae, the largest collection made in New Zealand waters up to that date. Of these 43 specimens, 29 adult or young eels referable to six genera and seven species and the remainder are leptocephali referable to nine genera and nine species. This dataset reports on the eels and eel-larvae of the Tui cruise.",

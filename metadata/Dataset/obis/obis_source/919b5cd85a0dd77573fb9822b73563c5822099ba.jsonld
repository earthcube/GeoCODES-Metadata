    "description": "A project investigating the restoration of string kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) habitat on Tasmania's east and south coasts. Macroalgae, fish and invertebrate counts were collected as part of the project using the Edgar Barrett transect technique in the Derwent Estuary and in the Mercury Passage on the South East Tasmania. Other fish, invertebrate and macroalgal data was also collected.\nData and reports accessed from https://metadata.imas.utas.edu.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/metadata.show?uuid=9d3e6280-44ab-11dc-8cd0-00188b4c0af8 on 2020-10-08.",

    "description": "Original provider:\nSea Sense\n\nDataset credits:\nSea Sense\nInstitut Français pour L'Exploitation de la Mer\nKélonia\n\nAbstract:\nSatellite tags were deployed on three nesting green turtles (Chelonia mydas) between March and July 2012 to address data gaps concerning the spatial dynamics of green turtle nesting populations in Tanzania.  Tags were deployed in Temeke District which supports one of the largest green turtle rookeries in Tanzania.\n\nTag durations ranged from 24 to 36 days. All three individuals went on to lay further clutches of eggs after tag deployment which provided valuable data on inter-nesting behaviour.   Two individuals spent their inter-nesting periods at the same location, 30km south of the nesting grounds.\n\nTwo of the tags failed before post-nesting migrations commenced.  One of the turtles was tracked during a post nesting migration to a foraging ground on the north-west coast of Pemba Island (Tanzania).  \n\nThis was the first sea turtle satellite telemetry project ever to be carried out in Tanzania and has confirmed the location of an important foraging ground in Pemba Island and a site utilised by gravid females during inter-nesting periods. \n\n\nPurpose:\nThe purpose of the satellite tracking project under SWIOFP was to facilitate the development of effective and sustainable management recommendations for protecting sea turtles at foraging and nesting sites and during migratory periods.\n\nIn Tanzania specifically, little is understood about the spatial dynamics of sea turtles which periodically move hundreds of kilometres between feeding grounds and nesting sites.  There is a paucity of data concerning the location of important foraging habitats and migratory corridors and the true extent of fisheries interactions during various stages of the turtle life cycle.  Lack of basic data is proving to be a major obstacle to the development and implementation of specific conservation and management actions in the wider western Indian Ocean region.",

Observations were made visually from the 5 m long inflatable boat or from 30 m cargo ship (in Litke Strait). Observed species include killer whale, minke whale, humpback whale, harbor porpoise and Dallâ€™s porpoise.\n\nPurpose:\nThe purpose of this study is to identify critical habitats for various cetacean species in the waters of the Russian Far East.\n\nSupplemental information:\nThe original did not include the second part of the time. Some records do not have time values.",

    "description": "Observer data collected from two small fishing vessels operating on the eastern seaboard during 2011 and 2012. Both vessels using the 'minor-line' fishing method on eastern seamounts, Fraser, Queensland, Recorder, Britania, Taupo and Barcoo. These vessels targeting Blue-eye Trevalla but also catch Harrisson's dogfish (Centrophorus harrissoni). Data comprised of complete catch composition (i.e. every fish put on deck was recorded) and partial length frequency mainly for Blue-eye and Harrisson's. Blue-eye otoliths also collected for another project examining population age structure. This information required to feed into management strategy for gulper sharks and also for designation of MPA's.",

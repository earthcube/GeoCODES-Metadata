    "description": "Measurements of biomass and productivity of seabed macrobenthic and megabenthic organisms, from studies in eastern North America from New England to the Canadian Arctic dating from 1954 to 2000, have been assembled into a comprehensive, georeferenced, database. Information sources include primary publications, technical reports and unpublished data from scientific studies, commercial fisheries surveys, and monitoring and baseline studies carried out for offshore petroleum exploration.\nThis resource contains biomass information from 24 sources for the following taxonomic groups: crustacea, echinodermata, mollusca, polychaeta and 'other'. This dataset contains 'absence' records as the source dataset includes valid biomass values of zero. Each data record includes a reference to the source in the DwC.associatedReferences field.\nVersion 1 of this resource was created during the Census of Marine Life.\nVersion 3 of this resource contains revised DwC records including occurrenceStatus (presence/absence) for the original 5 taxonomic groups plus fish.",

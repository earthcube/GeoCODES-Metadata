    "description": "In 1989, Fisheries and Oceans Canada initiated an investigation of a demoic acid incident which included a survey of Atlantic coastal waters to determine what potentially toxic species of phytoplankton were commonly present. In Nova Scotia this survey was conducted at five coastal sites over a period of three years. Approximately 26 times each year water samples were collected from 3 depths at each of the sites in Whitehaven Harbour, Ship Harbour, St. Margaret's Bay, Woods Harbour and Annapolis Basin. Phytoplankton in these samples were identified and counted. This dataset also includes information from two additional sites, Ship Harbour and Annapolis Basin.\n\nIn March 1992, DFO made a commitment to establish two long-term monitoring sites in Nova Scotia. Sampling at these sites, one at the mouth of Sambro Harbour and the other at Indian Point in Mahone Bay, began in July 1992 and continued till December of 1994.",

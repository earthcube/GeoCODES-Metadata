    "description": "White sharks were tagged at 10 locations in eastern Australia between October 2007 and November2017. Satellite-linked radio tags (hereafter referred to as tags) were attached to their first dorsal fin. Two models of tags were used: Wildlife ComputersÂ© SPOT and SPLASH tags. This dataset only describes the deployments of tags on 33 males and 44 females.",

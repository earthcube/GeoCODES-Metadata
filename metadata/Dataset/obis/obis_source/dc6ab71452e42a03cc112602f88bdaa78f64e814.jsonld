Surveys followed line-transect protocol and were designed to collect data for estimation of abundance and density of marine mammals. Survey dates were 21 to 27 July 2014, 14 to 21 September 2014, 5 to 12 January 2015 and 15 to 22 April 2015. Work was performed under HDR task order JP04 (IDIQ contract award N62470-10-D-3011, NAVFAC LANT).\n\nSupplemental information:\nA full version of downloadable data (ESRI personal geodatabase) including all attributes submitted is available upon request.",

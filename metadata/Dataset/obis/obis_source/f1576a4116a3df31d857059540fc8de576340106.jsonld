    "description": "The aim of this study, as part of a large number of related studies, was to examine the occurrence of cetaceans and seabirds along the 110◦E meridian from temperate to tropical waters (39.5–11.5◦S). Cetaceans and seabirds were actively scanned for across a four-week period spanning austral autumn to winter. Acoustic recordings of vocalising cetaceans weremade using directional and omnidirectional sonobuoys (n = 87 deployments). In total, seven cetacean sightings (six baleen whale, one toothed whale), 186 seabird sightings and 225 cetacean acoustic detections were recorded.\n\nA total of 22 seabird species were sighted, including, petrels, albatrosses, tropicbirds, terns, shearwaters, boobies, frigatebirds, gannets, gulls, skuas and prions.\nVoyage details (metadata, projects, other datasets either online or as downloads, publications and reports, events, maps etc) can be accessed at https://www.marine.csiro.au/data/trawler/survey_details.cfm?survey=IN2019_V03.

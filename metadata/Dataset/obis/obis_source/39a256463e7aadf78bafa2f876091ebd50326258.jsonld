    "name": "Ashmore Reef Marine Park Environmental Assessment 2019 - Shorebird and Seabird counts",
    "description": "For breedung seabirds, a single count was completed of active nests present on West, Middle and East Islands and Splittgerber Cay. The exception to this were the counts of Brown Booby, Black Noddy and Crested Tern nests on West Island. It was not possible to view all the breeding adults on this island without unduly disturbing the large numbers of nesting or roosting Sooty Terns and Brown Noddies. Single counts were also conducted of adult non-breeding birds such as Roseate and Bridled Terns.Further details of the observations and its limitations are in the cited paper",

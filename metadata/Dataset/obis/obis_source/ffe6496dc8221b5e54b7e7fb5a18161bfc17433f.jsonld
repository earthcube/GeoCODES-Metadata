    "description": "In the summer of 1923 an expedition was organized to investigate the waters of the Strait of Belle Isle and adjacent contributory waters. Hauls of plankton were made at various points, and some of these form the basis of two reports. \n\nAs part of a data recovery project information on species distribution contained in these reports was extracted and Darwin Core records created for submission to OBIS.",

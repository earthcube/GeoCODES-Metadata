    "description": "Original provider:\nProDelphinus &amp; Marine Turtle Research Group\n\nDataset credits:\nData provider\nMarine Turtle Research Group\nOriginating data center\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/\">Satellite Tracking and Analysis Tool (STAT)</a>\nProject sponsor or sponsor description\nFunding for the Pro Delphinus Leatherback Tracking Program comes from the Darwin Initiative, National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, and NOAA-Pacific Islands Regional Office.\n\n\nAbstract:\nProDelphinus is a Peruvian NGO whose aim is the conservation of threatened and endangered marine fauna which have interaction with Peruvian fisheries. We also work hard to promote environmental education and build capacity in local fishing communities with the goal of promoting the long-term sustainability of both the fisheries and the species with which they interact.Our Leatherback Tracking Project is the first telemetry study of the species in Peru. While leatherbacks occur along the entire Peru coast, both near and offshore, our research has identified a high number of interactions with gillnet fisheries in the north of the country. By tracking leatherbacks that have been caught in this fishery, this study will examine leatherback behavior and habitat use to help determine priority areas for conservation and to better understand how these habitats overlap with fishing grounds.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=958\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

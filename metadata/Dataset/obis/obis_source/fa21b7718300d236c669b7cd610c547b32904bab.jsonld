    "description": "Original provider:\nHDR Environmental, Operations and Construction, Inc.\n\nDataset credits:\nThe U.S. Navy Marine Species Monitoring Program\n\nAbstract:\nDuring 23 June through 1 August 2010, the 22nd Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC 2010)\nexercise was conducted in the Hawaii Range Complex (HRC). RIMPAC is a biennial,\nmultinational exercise designed to strengthen regional partnerships and improve\ninteroperability. It is an exercise designed to bring multinational military assets together\nto train towards bettering the Navyâ€™s capabilities. Anti-submarine warfare (ASW) was the\nexercise's main feature.\nAs part of compliance requirements with the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) of\n1972 and the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973, the Navy developed the HRC\nMonitoring Plan to provide marine mammal and sea turtle monitoring (DoN 2008). In\norder to effectively meet the goals outlined in this Plan, it was determined that one\nexample of training events recommended for monitoring should contain one or more\nsurface combatants conducting ASW during a regularly scheduled training event.\nResearch elements of that Plan include visual surveys and passive acoustic monitoring.\n\nThe monitoring effort for RIMPAC 2010 consisted of the following:\n- Vessel-based line transect surveys to assess the diversity, distribution, and\nbehavior of target species (e.g., marine mammals and sea turtles)\n- Installation of one shallow- and one deep-water passive acoustic monitors (PAMs)\nin waters off Ni'ihau.\n\nPurpose:\nnot provided\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2017-10-12] Data fields are changed so that they follow the other Navy datasets.\n\nThis dataset includes the data from the vessel-based line transect surveys.\n\nThe sighting of short-finned pilot whales and spinner dolphins on 7/19/10 was an aggregation of the two species and recorded as a single record. This sighting was split into each species in this dataset.",

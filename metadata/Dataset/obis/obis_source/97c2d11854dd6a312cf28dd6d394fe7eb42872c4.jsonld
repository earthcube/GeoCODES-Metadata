    "description": "Original provider:\nInstitute of Ecology and Evolution of Russian Academy of Sciences\n\nDataset credits:\nBoris Solovyev, Institute of Ecology and Evolution of Russian Academy of Sciences\n\nMarine Mammal Council\n\nAbstract:\nThe data on observation of white whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>) during the planned sailing of the research scientific ship \"Mikhail Somov\" (Arkhangelsk–Wrangel Island–Arkhangelsk) from September 6 to December 6 2010 are presented. The results obtained confirm and correct the existing ideas of the distribution of white whales and directions of their migrations in seas of the Russian Arctic.\n\nSupplemental information:\nAerial surveys were conducted on board a helicopter based at he Scientific-Expedition Ship Mikhail Somov. The tracks represent those of the helicopter.\n\nTracks were provided as summarized shapefiles and are not registered in the OBIS-SEAMAP database. Thus, spatial and temporal exploration of the tracks is not available online.\n\nAmong them, the tracks on 2010-10-08 are not shown due to the technical issue.",

    "description": "The Aquatic Invasive Species Settlement Plate Program deploys experimental settlement surfaces, usually small PVC plates, on floating structures such as docks, wharfs, and marinas throughout coastal British Columbia annually. It targets non-native biofouling species, although other taxa and common native species are also tracked. This dataset includes both non-native and common native tunicates and bryozoans, identified to species.",

    "description": "Original provider:\nUniversity of Maine\n\nDataset credits:\nNOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center\nJames Gilbert, University of Maine\nWendy Dow, Duke University\n\nAbstract:\nSeal populations in the northwest Atlantic are thriving, yet few grant dollars go to seal projects in the northeast region. According to many researchers and managers in the region, the healthy state of stocks is exactly why we should be studying seals. Seal and human activities along the coast often result in conflicts, which will undoubtedly increase as the population and range of both seals and humans increase. The east coast of the United States lacks a management plan for seals. A problem that seriously impedes management is that managers do not know where the seals are and more specifically, where haul-out sites are. This atlas is designed to aid managers and researchers in the management and conservation of seals in the northwest Atlantic. The atlas and the data used to create the atlas can be accessed through OBIS-SEAMAP.\n\nPurpose:\nThe purpose of this dataset and atlas is to provide data from a series of aerial surveys conducted between 1981 and 2001 of harbor and gray seal haul-out sites in Maine.\n\nSupplemental information:\nThe original data were transposed so that each record represents seals abundance at a single ledge on a single day. As this dataset is a time-series, an appropriate way to represent it is to show it with time-series charts by region. Currently, OBIS-SEAMAP lets you see it on Google Earth with the charts. Not all seasons are represented in this dataset, and distributions of seals may be different in other seasons. Lack of a count for a ledge on a particular date does not necessarily mean the ledge was not observed.",

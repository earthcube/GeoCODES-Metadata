    "description": "Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Peru, Uruguay, and more recently Venezuela have done marine biological work in the Antarctica, mainly around the Antarctic Peninsula and Drake Passage. A compilation of the marine biodiversity registered in the South American Antarctic literature is shown here. Most of the initial Brazilian manuscripts and one Argentinean have been screened to pull their georeferenced marine species occurrence. So far, 11 phyla, 56 genera, and 73 species have been recorded mainly from King George Island and a few from other islands in the South Shetlands. The majority of manuscripts relates to Bivalvia (Mollusca) (23%), and Malacostraca (Crustacea) (23%). More information shall be added to this work as the datamining continues including all South American countries literature.",

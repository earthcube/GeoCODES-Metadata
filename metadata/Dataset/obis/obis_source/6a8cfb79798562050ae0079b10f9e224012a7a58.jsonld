    "description": "Recording Invasive Species Counts (RISC) alongside ALERT was launched in 2010 and includes on-line recording for 19 species including the Chinese Mitten Crab <i>Eriocheir sinensis</i>, Wakame <i>Undaria pinnatifida</i> and Carpet Sea Squirt <i>Didemnum vexillum</i>. The data is predominantly provided by members of the public but records are verified from photos by designated experts. No additional attribute data is included for the Carpet Sea Squirt. The recording forms for Chinese Mitten Crab and Wakame includes the option to provide abundance. Additionally for the Chinese Mitten Crab information on whether it is dead or alive is recorded and for Wakame attachment method (attached to boat, attached to other man-made surface, attach to natural surface or detached) is recorded.",

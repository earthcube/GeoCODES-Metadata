    "description": "Ceratioid anglerfishes collected from New Zealand waters are reviewed on the basis of all known material. Twenty species in nine genera and six families are recognised; nine species represent new records for the region, and one species of Oneirodes is described as new to science. Diagnostic and descriptive data are given with notes on geographical distribution. Diagnoses of all ceratioid families are provided, against the possibility of capture within the New Zealand EEZ",

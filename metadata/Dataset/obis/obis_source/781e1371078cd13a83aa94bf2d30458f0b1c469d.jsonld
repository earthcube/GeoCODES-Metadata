    "description": "Makiling Biodiversity Information System (MakiBIS) is an online portal of diverse species composition of Mt. Makiling lifted from various published materials. It serves a single repository of biodiversity species documented within MFR that allows user to readily access available information of each taxon via internet. The system shared the information globally-based on standards of Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) using Darwin Core platform, particularly the taxonomic information of the species recorded. MakiBIS is envisioned to be a prototype system that calls for an initiative to have nationwide biodiversity information system known as Philippine Biodiversity Information System (PhilBIS) through interagency and multidisciplinary partnership. The creation of a database system released in the worldwide web provides avenue among users in the world to view and appreciate the ecological importance of biodiversity in any given country.",

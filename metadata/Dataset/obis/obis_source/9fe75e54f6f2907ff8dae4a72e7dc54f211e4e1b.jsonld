    "description": "Original provider:\nEscola de Mar\n\nDataset credits:\nEscola de Mar\n\nAbstract:\nThroughout the years some researchers have dedicated their\nefforts to the study of cetaceans’ occurrence off Mainland\nPortugal. However, it is still missing a systemic scientific\nmethodology for studying the presence of coastal dolphins and\nwhales. This work intends to be a first approach on the occurrence of cetaceans off the west central coast of Portugal. Our objective was to contribute towards the compilation of relevant “forgotten science” such as whaling data and observations of opportunity, together with two years of boat-based surveys.\nWe found 1,313 occurrences of great whales captured off\nSetúbal and Sesimbra (1925-1927 and 1944-1951) and a total\nof 45 cetaceans in non-directed captures between 1976 and\n1978. We accounted 45 dolphins and whales in sea-sightings\nas a result of observations of opportunity, from 2002 to 2008.\nIn 2007 and 2008 a total of 63 boat-based visual surveys were\nconducted from three different geographic locations, Nazaré,\nPeniche and Sesimbra, and as a result 45 independent sightings\nof cetaceans were recorded. The most frequent small dolphin\noff the Portuguese mainland coast is the common dolphin\n(<i>Delphinus delphis</i>) as shown by the three distinct approaches used in this study. Regarding whales the most common species is the fin whale (<i>Balaenoptera physalus</i>) as shown by whaling records. Overall, the small delphinid community along the central coast of Portugal is similar to the one that can be found along the Iberia shore.\nThis dataset contains only the boat-based sightings.\n\nPurpose:\nThis work intends to be a preliminary approach on the\noccurrence of cetaceans off the west central coast of Portugal.\nOur objective was to contribute towards the compilation of\nrelevant “forgotten science”, namely 20th century whaling and\ndolphin capture data and opportunistic observers’ reports on\nwhales and dolphins, in order to reduce the lack of knowledge\nin central mainland Portugal. This information together with\nboat-based surveys for obtaining new biological data is a\nstarting point for a new methodological approach.\n\nSupplemental information:\nRecords did not have time recorded and were filled with 00:00:00. Records that did not have group size recorded were filled with 1. When an estimated range of animals was sighted, the median value (rounded down) was used as the observed count. Time and group size details are recorded in the [Notes] column.\nThree opportunistic sightings of <i>Delphinus delphis</i> recorded for August 2007 were excluded because the day information was not available. One erroneous record of <i>Delphinus delphis</i> sightings on land was also excluded.",

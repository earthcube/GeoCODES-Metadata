    "description": "Spiny lobster phyllosoma samples (Panulirus cygnus) were collected from the RV Southern Surveyor (CSIRO, Australia) in the Indian Ocean off Western Australia from 27 August to 1 September 2011. The sampling sites included four eddies; two pairs of adjacent cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies. Samples were collected at night with a surface net (1 m2 opening, 1 mm mesh towed at 0â€“3 m depth) for around 10 min at less than 3.7 km h-1.\n",

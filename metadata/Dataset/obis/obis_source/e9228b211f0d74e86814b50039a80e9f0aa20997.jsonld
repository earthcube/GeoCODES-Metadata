    "description": "GPS tracking devices were deployed  on far eastern curlews  (Numenius madagascariensis)  at two sites in northwest Australia (Broome n = 8 [−17.7513°N, 122.5528°E], Darwin n = 3 [−12.4867°N, 130.8927°E]) and two sites in southeast Australia (Moreton Bay n = 8 [−27.0335°N, 153.0925°E], Western Port n = 3 [−38.2321°N, 145.4820°E])  over the course of two nonbreeding seasons, November–March 2017/2018 and November–March 2018/2019. A total of 22 individuals were fitted with either a solar-powered GPS-GSM transmitter (15 or 20 g Ornitrack, Ornitela, Lithuania) or an Argos solar-powered platform transmitter terminal.

    "description": "Eleven fish surveys were conducted by the Soela from 1980 to 1984 using midwater, bongo, surface net, plankton, pelagic, dermersal and longlining techniques. Taxa groups include fish, plankton,  squid etc.\nThis data has been republished (2022-08-29 with additional details of each occurrence where they can be one of three types:  catch composition (counts per taxa and optional aggregated weights by trawl event), catch measurements (length and/or weight) of individual taxa and/or catch specimens and their stored location. The occurrence type is recorded in occurrenceremarks.\n\n",

    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nNOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC)\n\nAbstract:\nMid Atlantic Tursiops Surveys (MATS) were conducted in 1995 by NOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center to examine the distribution and estimate an index of relative abundance for Atlantic bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>) inhabiting the nearshore coastal waters in mid-and southern Atlantic bight. This data set contains sightings of not only the target dolphins but also other species including cetaceans, sea turtles, fish and shark observed during the aerial surveys.\nThe same transects were traced three times on different dates during the survey period. This data set is the last one. The other two are provided, too, with the number following MATS95s indicating the first, second and last.\nCetacean and sea turtles observed included:\nCetaceans:\n- Atlantic spotted dolphin\n- False killer whale\n- Standard Bottlenose dolphin\nSea Turtles:\n- Hardshell\n- Kemp's ridley\n- Leatherback\n- Loggerhead\n\nThis survey's transects information is available in MATS95s3Efforts.\n\nPurpose:\nThe purpose of this survey was to examine the distribution and estimate an index of relative abundance for Atlantic bottlenose dolphins inhabiting the nearshore coastal waters of the U.S. mid- and southern Atlantic bight.\n\nSupplemental information:\nRecords with no common name were observations of pollution (e.g., plastic).\nRecords were assigned a sequential number LineNo. LineNo can be used to match observations with corresponding transects, each of which has BegLineNo and EndLineNo fields. Observation records with their LineNo between BegLineNo and EndLineNo in a transect are related to  that transect.\nA duplicated LineNo indicates more than one species were observed at the same time.\nRecords include 'off-effort' sightings as well. Card 'F' indicates the observation was done while off-effort. Card D was used for observation while on effort.\nWhen searching for a specific species, note that some records don't identify animals observed at a species level. If this is the case, the common/scientific name may be genus/family or higher (e.g., <i>Balaenoptera</i> sp.).",

    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nNational Marine Fisheries Service\n\nAbstract:\nThe cruise period was from 06 August - 07 September 1995. The area of operation was Georges Bank and waters east of Cape Cod.\n\nPurpose:\nThe primary objectives of the survey were to: (1) conduct line-transect population surveys within the study area, and (2) investigate cetacean distribution on the southern portion of Georges Bank, principally between the 30 f isobath and 10 nm beyond the 1000 f curve. Secondary objectives included: (1) collecting information on the relationship cetaceans and oceanographic features, (2) the collection of CTD and zooplankton data, (3) conducting marine mammal photographic\nidentification studies using a rigid bottom inflatable boat and (4) collecting biopsy samples for stock identification and contaminant studies.\n\nSupplemental information:\nIn addition to the sighting data, effort data was recorded  every half hour or whenever conditions change.\nThis dataset, therefore, should be used with the effort data.",

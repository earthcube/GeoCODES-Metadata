    "description": "A survey of zooplankton abundance and distribution was initiated in 1968, as a part of a multidisciplinary program designed to study biological and physical processes pertinent to the marine food web in St. Margarets Bay, Nova Scotia, and was carried through to April 1971. Samples were collected using plankton ring nets with the objective to examine seasonal variation in abundance of important species/taxa of zooplankton.",

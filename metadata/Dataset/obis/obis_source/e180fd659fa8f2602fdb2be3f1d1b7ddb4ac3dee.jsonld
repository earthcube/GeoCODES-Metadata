    "description": "Plankton surveys were completed in 1920 and in 1951 in the Bay of Fundy to compare zooplankton abundance in the inner and outer regions where marked differences in fish production were well known. Distribution information associated with these studies (Jermolajev 1958) were digitized, standardized and republished as part of the Atlantic Coastal Zone Information Steering Committee (ACZISC) Atlantic Ecosystem Initiative (AEI) funded project “Atlantic Canada’s Biological Data for Ecosystem Planning and Decision-making” and OBIS Canada.",

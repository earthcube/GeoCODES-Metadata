    "description": "The mammal collection focuses on Queensland and Papua New Guinea regions, documenting an historical record of species distributions, past and present.\nSkin, skeleton and spirit collections dating back to the 1870s provide a valuable reference resource for biological and ecological studies.\nThis dataset is of marine species sourced from the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) January 2019 (https://collections.ala.org.au/public/show/co150). Taxa have been matched to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) and if not then matched to the Australian Faunal Directory (AFD)",

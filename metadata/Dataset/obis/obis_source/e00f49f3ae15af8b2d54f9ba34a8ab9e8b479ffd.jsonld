    "description": "A multidisciplinary voyage aboard the R.V. Investigator voyage IN2019_V03 as part of the Second International Indian Ocean Expedition examined the physical, biogeochemical and biological properties of the 110 E line between 17 May and 6 June 2019. A total of 20 stations were sampled for zooplankton along the 110◦E line over which the depth of the seafloor was generally between 4000 and 6000 m. Sampling started in temperate waters at 39.5◦S (Station 1) and ended in tropical waters at 11.5 S (Station 20), with stations spaced ~1.5 deg apart.\nAn Indian Ocean Standard Net (area of 1 m2, net diameter of 113 cm and mesh size of 335 μm; Hydro-Bios), originally designed for the first\nIIOE (Currie, 1963), was used to collect zooplankton samples. The net which was fitted with a heavy cod end frame filled with lead was rapidly\nlowered over the side of the stationary ship to a depth of 200 m and then vertically hauled through the water column at a speed of about 0.5 m per sec. The volume of water filtered per sample was approximately 200 m3; a flowmeter was not used. Zooplankton samples were preserved in 10% buffered formalin in seawater for later laboratory analyses.\nData accessed from cited article on 2022-06-15.

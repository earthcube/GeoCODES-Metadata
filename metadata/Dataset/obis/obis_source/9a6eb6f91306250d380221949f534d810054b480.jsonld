    "description": "Within the frame work, organized by the National Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries, Alexandria, Egypt, 15 quantitative samples were collected and analysed for Polychaetes using a Van Veen grab on the soft bottom, at depths ranging from 12m to 106 m. Samples were taken over two seasons (spring and summer, 2008) during two trips to the Northeastern coast of the Egyptian Mediterranean waters at El Tina Bay, Balteem, Abokhashaba and Gamasa.",

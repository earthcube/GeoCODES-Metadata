    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nNOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC)\n\nAbstract:\nThis dataset includes data from Cruise No. EN 04-395/396, collected on the ship R/V Endeavor. Leg I was conducted from 23 June to 12 July 2004. Leg II was conducted from 16 July to 4 August 2004. Both legs started and ended in Narragansett, Rhode Island, United States. The study area for both legs was in mid-Atlantic waters from the 100 m depth contour to the Gulf Stream, from Virginia to Cape Cod, Massachusetts, United States.\n\nPurpose:\nThe primary objectives of the survey were to:\n1) Determine the spatial distribution and abundance of cetaceans and turtles in the study region,\n2) Determine the spatial distribution and relative abundance of sea birds in the same region, and \n3) Use passive acoustics to record vocalizing cetaceans that will hopefully be used to improve the abundance estimates derived from the visual surveys.\n\nA secondary objective was to compare the distribution of these species with each other, physical characteristics, such as water depth and temperature, and biological characteristics, such as relative plankton distribution.\n\nSupplemental information:\nThis shipboard survey was conducted in conjunction with an aerial survey '<a href=\"http://seamap.env.duke.edu/datasets/detail/398\">NEFSC aerial circle-back abundance survey 2004</a>', also available as a separate datset on OBIS-SEAMAP.",

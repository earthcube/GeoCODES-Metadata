    "description": "Abundance and biomass of fish species collected during the day from 1977 to 1989 off the coast of the southeastern United States (Cape Fear, NC to Cape Canaveral, FL). Blackfish traps were set on live-bottom reef areas at depths &lt; 50 m. Blackfish trap were nearly cubic (0.6 m x 0.6 m x 0.5 m; 0.16 m3 volume) and constructed of 38-mm (1.5-inch) octagonal mesh (\"chicken wire\"). Each trap consisted of two entrances (0.13 m diameter, 0.09 m length) and one bait well (0.10 m diameter, 0.25 m length). Each trap was soaked between 90 and 120 mintues.",

    "description": "Original provider:\nBiodiversity East / MTRG\n\nDataset credits:\nData provider\nMarine Turtle Research Group\nOriginating data center\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/\">Satellite Tracking and Analysis Tool (STAT)</a>\nProject partner\nThe scientific work is undertaken by ALan Rees, PhD student with the MTRG at the University of Exeter, with additional advice and assistance from Michael Coyne of SEATURTLE.ORG. This project is carried out under the auspices of the Ministry of Environment and Climate Affairs of Oman.\nProject sponsor or sponsor description\nThe project is funded by Total SA, Muscat Branch and the TOTAL Corporate Foundation for Biodiversity and the Sea.\n\n\nAbstract:\nMasirah Island hosts four species of nesting turtles, Loggerheads, Greens, Hawksbills and Olive Ridleys.This project will provide evidence of migration routes and raise awareness of this threatened and depleted population of green turtles.The Ministry of Environment and Climate Affairs of Oman has recently intensified its efforts to gain more knowledge on sea turtles, focusing on satellite telemetry.Within the context of these efforts and as a continuation of the three-year turtle conservation project, which included the pioneering and successful Loggerhead telemetry mission on Masirah Island in May 2006, TOTAL S.A. Muscat and TOTAL Corporate Foundation for Biodiversity and the Sea are now sponsoring this Green Turtle telemetry project.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=310\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

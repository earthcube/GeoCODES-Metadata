    "description": "Original provider:\nMark Dodd\n\nDataset credits:\nData provider\nGeorgia Department of Natural Resources\nOriginating data center\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/\">Satellite Tracking and Analysis Tool (STAT)</a>\nProject partner\nThis project is a collaboration between the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, the University of Georgia-Warnell School of Forest Resources, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Fish &amp; Wildlife Foundation, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\n\n\nAbstract:\nThe purpose of this study is to document inter-nesting habitat use, migratory pathways, and post-nesting movements of Georgia?s nesting loggerhead turtles using satellite and conventional telemetry. Loggerhead turtle movements will be compared with the distributions of commercial fishing and dredging activity and results will be used to make management recommendations to protect adult loggerhead sea turtles and their habitats. During the second year of our study, We deployed a total of twelve satellite transmitters on Sapelo (8) and Blackbeard Islands (4). In addition to monitoring loggerhead movement patterns, our tracking project provides a unique educational opportunity for students to learn more about Georgia?s loggerhead turtles and coastal marine ecosystems.  School kids from grades K-5 were given the opportunity to submit names for eight of the turtles. Over 240 Georgia students in kindergarten through fifth grade took part in the sea turtle naming contest. Click on each individual turtle to get more information.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=82\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

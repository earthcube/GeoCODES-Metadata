    "description": "Original provider:\nRussian Cetacean Habitat Project\n\nDataset credits:\nRussian Cetacean Habitat Project\n\nFar East Russia Orca Project\n\nWhale and Dolphin Conservation Society\n\nAbstract:\nThese data were collected via land-based observations from Poludennaya Bay, Beringa Island (Commander Islands) in May-June 2007, May-July 2008 and August-September 2009. The observation point was located on a 40 m cliff. Bearing and distance to the observed whales were defined by binoculars with a compass and range-finding reticle. Observations were conducted during all daylight hours, if visibility was more than 5 km. We made one 15 minute scan every half hour and noted all cetaceans observed during the scan. Consequently, in many cases we could note the same animal several times in different scans. Observed species include killer whale, minke whale, humpback whale, fin whale, sei whale, sperm whale, Baird’s beaked whale, harbor porpoise and Dall’s porpoise.\n\nPurpose:\nThe purpose of this study is to identify critical habitats for various cetacean species in the waters of the Russian Far East.\n\nSupplemental information:\nThe original did not include the second part of the time.",

    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nNOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC)\n\nAbstract:\nThe 2009 \"Ecosystem Survey of Delphinus Species\" research survey focused on the two species of common dolphin, <i>Delphinus delphis</i> and <i>D. capensis</i>, found off southern California, USA, and Baja California, Mexico. The primary objective was to provide information to improve conservation and management plans for these species. The project used a multidisciplinary approach. For both <i>Delphinus</i> species, data were collected to estimate abundance, pregnancy and birth rates, timing of reproduction, gene flow, and \ncontaminant concentrations. Oceanographic data were collected to characterize habitat, and data on distribution and abundance of seabirds, prey fishes, and squids were collected to further characterize the ecosystem in which these dolphins live. Photographs of dolphin schools were taken from a NOAA Twin Otter aircraft while the survey was being conducted.  The aerial photographs will provide count and measurement data to calibrate observer \nestimates of school size and to estimate timing of reproduction and birth rates.  This research will facilitate understanding population demography of these species in an ecosystem framework. Essential information about the primary focal species, <i>D. capensis</i>, will greatly increase our knowledge about this coastal species and the geographic extent of a Mexico-U.S. transboundary stock. For additional information about the Delphinus cruise, please see http://swfsc.noaa.gov/prd-delphinus.aspx.\n\nPurpose:\nThe primary objectives of the 2009 Delphinus ecosystem cruise were (1) to characterize the distribution, habitat and reproductive characteristics of long- and short-beaked common dolphins, and (2) to improve non-lethal sampling techniques for studying reproduction in wild, free-ranging cetaceans.\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2021-04-13] Updated with additional attributes.\n\nSWFSC MMTD Cruise Number: 1640\nPerpendicular distance will be released upon permission by the contributor. Please contact the contributor if needed.\n\nAttribute descriptions for effort data:\ndist: Length of the segment (km) \nMode: Effort mode type (C = closing mode; P = passing mode)",

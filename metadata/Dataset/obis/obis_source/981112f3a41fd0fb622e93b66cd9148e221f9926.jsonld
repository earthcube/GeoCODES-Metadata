    "description": "Between 1947 and 1956 a study lead by Mick Olsen resulted in 6502 school and 587 gummy sharks being tagged in south-east Australia. Most of the school shark were tagged in inshore bays and estuaries, notably Port Phillip Bay, Port Sorell, Georges Bay and Pittwater. Most of the gummy shark were tagged in inshore areas around Flinders Island and the north coast of Tasmania. A total of 594 school shark and 60 gummy shark were recaptured. This data set includes field sheets and the tags returned to CSIRO.",

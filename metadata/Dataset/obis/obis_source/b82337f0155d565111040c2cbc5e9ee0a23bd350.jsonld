    "description": "Original provider:\nKYMA sea conservation &amp; research\n\nDataset credits:\nSilvia Frey, KYMA sea conservation &amp; research\n\nAbstract:\nThis dataset, belonging as a whole to KYMA sea conservation &amp; research, comprises the monitoring data on great pelagics, mainly cetaceans and sea turtles, carried out in the central Mediterranean Sea, in particular in the southern Thyrrhenian Sea and western Ionian Sea since 2020. The research project is set up as a citizen science project. Spatial and temporal distribution of animals is studied using boat-based surveys.\n\nPurpose:\nKYMA sea conservation &amp; research is a non-profit and non-governmental organization dedicated to the conservation of life in the oceans. It has been founded in 2019. The work of the young organization includes field research at sea and environmental education projects.\n\nWith this monitoring project KYMA sea conservation &amp; research aims at providing long-term data on the abundance of cetaceans and other great pelagics in the central Mediterranean Sea.\n\nSupplemental information:\nEffort data will be provided in the future.",

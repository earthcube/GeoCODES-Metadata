    "description": "This is the OBIS extraction of the Ocean Tracking Network  and Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM)  MANGA - (Tag) Habitat use of oceanic manta rays, consisting of the release tagging metadata, i.e. the location and date when the tagged animal was released, and summarized detection events of tagged individuals.\n    If readers are interested in the source dataset they may also inquire with the project PIs as listed here or on the OTN web site (https://members.oceantrack.org/project?ccode=FACT.MANGA).\nAbstract:The purpose of this study is to understand how movements and site fidelity of endangered oceanic manta rays (Mobula birostris) affect the risk of this species interacting with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) marine mineral extraction or associated mitigation activities as part of their Marine Minerals Program (MMP). Acoustic telemetry will be used to determine habitat use patterns within existing receiver arrays at the Canaveral Shoals sand borrow area, whereas animal-borne inertial tags will be used to characterize behavior at fine spatial and temporal scales. Together, these techniques leverage the target species as a mobile oceanographic platform advancing the utility of animal telemetry for ocean monitoring while providing data on the risks of negative interactions between endangered megafauna and mineral extraction activities, thus facilitating improved mitigation. Data produced from this study will feed into robust education and outreach programs underway at Georgia Aquarium, which is one of the worldâ€™s largest public aquariums and features giant manta rays as a flagship exhibit species.",

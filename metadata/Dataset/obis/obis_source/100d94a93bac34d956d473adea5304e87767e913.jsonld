    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nNOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC)\n\nAbstract:\nAs part of the AMAPPS program, the Southeast Fisheries \nScience Center conducted an aerial survey on the \ncontinental shelf waters of the US east coast, from \nVirginia to the Florida Keys. The survey was conducted \nbetween 7 December 2019 and 25 January 2020 aboard a NOAA \nTwin Otter aircraft. Survey tracklines were oriented \nperpendicular to the shoreline and latitudinally spaced \n20 \nkm apart. The main goal of this survey was to assess the \ndistribution and abundance of marine mammals and sea \nturtles in the US east coast. The survey was designed for \nanalysis using Distance sampling and a two-team \n(independent observer) approach to correct for perception \nbias in resulting abundance estimates. Due to unfavorable \nweather conditions (mainly fog and heavy winds) \nthroughout \nthe survey the northernmost area surveyed was off the \nVirginia coast. In addition, from northern South Carolina \nto VA, several segments of the proposed tracklines were \nnot surveyed due to military exercises being conducted \nover the area.\n\nPurpose:\nThe main goal of this survey was to assess the distribution \nand abundance of marine mammals and sea turtles in the US \neast coast.\n\nSupplemental information:\nPerpendicular distance to the animal is not publicly \navailable.\n\nThe dataset is accompanied by transect (effort) data \nwhich \nis provided as a separate file.\nSightings included were detected on-effort by the forward \nteam only; you may request the full dataset and sightings \nincluding opportunistic ones directly to the provider.\n\nEnvironmental Attribute Codes\nBeaufort Sea state\n0 Calm, mirror like seas\n1 Waves &lt;1ft, rippled surface\n2 Small wavelets (&lt;2 ft), no white caps\n3 Large wavelets (&lt;3ft), scattered white caps\n4 Swell 3-4 ft, numerous white caps\n5 Swell &gt;5 ft, many white caps, some spray\n6 Swell &gt;10 ft, white caps everywhere, spray\nCloudCover\n0 Clear\n1 0-25% Cloudy\n2 26-50% Cloudy\n3 51-75% Cloudy\n4 76-100% Cloudy\n5 Overcast\nGlare (Glare intensity)\n0 No Impairment\n1 Slight Impairment\n2 Moderate Impairment\n3 Severe Impairment\nWeather\n0 Clear\n1 Mist\n2 Light Rain\n3 Heavy Rain\nConditions\n0 Poor\n1 Fair\n2 Moderate\n3 Good\n4 Excellent\nHaze\n0 No\n1 Yes\nFog\n0 No\n1 Yes\nSun penetration (Sun pen)\n0 Poor\n1 Fair\n2 Good\n3 Excellent\nTurbidity\n0 Poor\n1 Fair\n2 Good\n3 Excellent",

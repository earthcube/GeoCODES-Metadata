    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nNOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC)\n\nAbstract:\nIn 2015, NOAA Fisheries Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) undertook a Collaborative Large Whale Survey (CLaWS) from 9 July through 9 November aboard NOAA Ship Reuben Lasker. The survey was a collaborative effort between SWFSC and NOAA Fisheries Alaska Fisheries Science Center.  \nThe study was conducted in U.S. and Canadian waters of the eastern North Pacific (ENP) between the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, and San Diego, California (Fig. 1). The survey was separated into five legs, ranging from 15 to 25 days. The fourth leg of the survey occurred in Canadian Pacific coastal waters between 28 September and 22 October and was a collaborative effort with Dr. John Ford of the Cetacean Research Program, Pacific Biological Station, Fisheries and Oceans Canada.\n\nPurpose:\nCLAWS = Collaborative Large Whale Survey.\nObjective: photo ID study of the Pacific Coast Feeding Group (PCFG) of gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) between central California and Kodiak, Alaska. \nVessel: NOAA Ship Reuben Lasker.  \nStudy area: U.S. and Canadian waters of the Eastern North Pacific (ENP) between the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, and San Diego, California.\n\nSupplemental information:\nSWFSC MMTD Cruise Number: 1648\nPerpendicular distance will be released upon permission by the contributor. Please contact the contributor if needed.\n\nAttribute descriptions for effort data:\ndist: Length of the segment (km) \nMode: Effort mode type (C = closing mode; P = passing mode)",

    "description": "Original provider:\nTAMUG STFERL\n\nDataset credits:\nData provider\nTAMUG Sea Turtle and Fisheries Ecology Research Lab\nOriginating data center\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/\">Satellite Tracking and Analysis Tool (STAT)</a>\nProject partner\nThe TAMUG STFERL partners with the NOAA Sea Turtle Facility in Galveston, Texas, to respond to reports of nesting activity on upper Texas coast beaches, relocate nests, and satellite tag nesters. Houston Zoo veterinary staff provide expertise in assessing the health and reproductive status (via sonography) of females prior to satellite tag application.\nProject sponsor or sponsor description\nFunding for seven nesting ridleys tracked by the STFERL in 2007 and 2008 was provided by the Texas General Land Office Coastal Management Program, as well as by donations made through seaturtle.org and Help Endangered Animals - Ridley Turtles (HEART).Educational beach signage, posters, bookmarks, and stickers requesting public reporting of sea turtle tracks and sightings in Texas were printed by HEART/Sea Turtle Restoration Project (Gulf Office).\n\n\nAbstract:\nThe Texas A&amp;M University at Galveston (TAMUG) Sea Turtle and Fisheries Ecology Research Lab (STFERL) initiated a satellite tracking study in 2005 to document inter- and post-nesting movements of sea turtles intercepted nesting on upper Texas coast beaches, as well as nester fidelity to beach habitats, migratory routes, and Gulf of Mexico foraging grounds. The STFERL's ongoing tracking program seeks to fill voids in our knowledge of the in-water and nesting dynamics of Kemp's ridleys and generate data essential to revising the Kemp's Ridley Recovery Plan.  Other TAMUG STFERL tracks are available on the <a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/?project_id=208\">TAMUG  Kemp's Ridley Tracking 2007</a>, <a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/?project_id=45\">TAMUG Kemp's Ridley Tracking 2004-2006</a>, <a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/?project_id=157\">TAMUG Green Turtle Tracking</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/?project_id=221\">TAMUG Loggerhead Tracking</a> pages.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=272\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

    "description": "Original provider:\nInternational Fund for Animal Welfare\n\nDataset credits:\nInternational Fund for Animal Welfare\n\nAbstract:\nBoat-based acoustic and visual surveys for harbor porpoises (<i>Phocoena phocoena</i>) were conducted during the summers of 2001 and 2002 in order to investigate their distribution and relative abundance in the Baltic Sea, and to compare the results with the adjacent Kiel and Mecklenburg Bights and the Little Belt.\n\nPurpose:\nHarbor porpoises are subject to year-round bycatch in gillnets and other fishing gear in these waters. This is of particular concern in the Baltic Sea where a survey carried out in 1995 indicated that the population is low and current levels of anthropogenic mortality are believed to be unsustainable.\n\nSupplemental information:\n6/15/2010: The primary contact was changed from Douglas Gillespie to Anna Moscrop upon provider request.\n\n\n\nAcoustic sound files are not available in OBIS-SEAMAP.\nThis dataset includes acoustic events only.\n\nData for visual sightings during the survey are available in Baltic Porpoise Sightings 01-02.",

    "description": "During the cruises of the Danish research steamer “Thor” in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean in the years 1908-1909 and 1910, a very large material of speciments belonging to the Scopelidae, and especially to the genus Myctophum, Rafinesque, was collected. The Mediterranean part of the material is dealt with in the present work, including not only the adult forms, but also postlarval and adolescent stages; in nearly all cases indeed, it was found possible to refer the postlarval stages with certainty to their respective species. For purposes of comparison and reference, also, use has been made of the not less extensive material procured by the research schooner: “Margrethe” on a cruise from the Faeroes to West Indies in 1913, as also a large amount collected at the instigation of the Royal Danish Committee for the Study of the Sea by Danish merchant vessels in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic. A smaller batch of material also, collected on the shore at Messina, March 1911, has likewise been included for treatment here.",

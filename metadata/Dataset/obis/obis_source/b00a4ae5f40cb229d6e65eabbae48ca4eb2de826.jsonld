DiGiovanni Jr. &amp; Allison M. DePerte\n\nAbstract:\nThere have been no consistent, year-round marine mammal surveys of the ocean waters off of Maryland since the late 1970s (Scott et al. 1979). Current survey efforts by the National Marine Fisheries Service and partner agencies as part of the Atlantic Marine Assessment Program for Protected Species (AMAPPS) include broad scale surveys that may not provide sufficient data for the Maryland Wind Energy Area. Data on protected species presence and seasonality are needed to inform state and federal agencies responsible for permitting offshore energy development and construction (BOEM 2013). The goal of this two year effort was designed to provide fine scale data on presence of protected species, especially large whales, for Maryland’s wind development efforts.\n\nPurpose:\nThe goal of this two year effort was designed to provide fine scale data on presence of protected species, especially large whales, for Maryland’s wind development efforts.\n\nSupplemental information:\nStatic line transect image is available to visualize.",

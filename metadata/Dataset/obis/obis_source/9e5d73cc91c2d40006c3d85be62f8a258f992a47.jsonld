    "description": "RV Tangaroa carried out a six-week voyage to Antarctica and the Southern Ocean between 9 February and 21 March 2018 with scientists from NIWA and the University of Auckland.\nScientists did a range of surveys to better understand the processes governing this environment and its relevance to New Zealand. These included oceanographic observations, atmospheric observations, whale and benthic habitat studies, along with studies of plankton communities. The whale studies were carried out by the University of Auckland.\nThe research aims of the voyage were to better understand:\n\n* Climate change effects on oceanographic processes; \n* Marine microbial community structure and function ;\n* Influence of marine aerosols on cloud formation and properties of Antarctic clouds; \n* Seabed habitats and fauna inside and outside of the Ross Sea Marine Protected Area (MPA); \n* The role of whales in the Antarctic ecosystem; \n* Abundance and distribution of mesopelagic fish found between 200 and 100m deep, krill, and zooplankton\n\nOne of the key outcomes of the research will be to generate baseline data required to determine whether the objectives of the MPA are being achieved. The MPA covers more than 1.55 million square kilometres and came into existence in December.\nhe ship carried 23 scientists and 17 crew. Together their work ranged from taking atmospheric and oceanographic observations and samples, to whale spotting, maintaining the vessel, and cooking meals around the clock to service the 24-hour operation of the ship.",

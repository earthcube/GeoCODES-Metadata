    "description": "Fast-acquisition satellite telemetry was used to track eleven dugongs and ten green turtles at two geographically distinct foraging locations in Queensland, Australia to evaluate the inter- and intra-species spatial relationships and assess the efficacy of existing protection zones. Home-range analysis and bathymetric modeling were used to  determine spatial use and compared with existing protection areas using GIS.\nMetadata and data downloads are at https://eatlas.org.au/data/uuid/73f2acfd-1cb7-48a5-a3e4-bad38939e4e9",

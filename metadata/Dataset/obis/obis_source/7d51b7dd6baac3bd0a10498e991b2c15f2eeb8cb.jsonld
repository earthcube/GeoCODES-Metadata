    "description": "This is the OBIS extraction of the OTN St. Mary's River Salmon Tracking project, consisting only of the release tagging metadata. i.e. the locations  and dates of tagged animal release. If readers are  interested in the full source  dataset they should refer to the OTN web site  (members.oceantrack.org). Abstract: This project examines the within-river migrations of wild adult Atlantic salmon prior, during and post-spawning. Additionally, the project simultaneously tracks supportive-reared adult salmon (collected as wild parr and grown to maturity) released back to their natal water to spawn.",

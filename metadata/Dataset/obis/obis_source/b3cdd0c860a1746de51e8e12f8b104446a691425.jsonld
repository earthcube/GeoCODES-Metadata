    "description": "Original provider:\nMarijke N. de Boer\n\nDataset credits:\nMarijke N. de Boer\n\nAbstract:\nMinke whales and other marine mammals were recorded in the central \nNorth Sea in an area characterised by frontal features and high productivity \nnortheast of the Dogger Bank (4677 km2). Survey efforts were carried\nout from 28 March to 2 July 2007, at a finer scale than in earlier studies in \nthe region, using 2 vessels as platforms of opportunity and a dedicated line-\ntransect survey vessel following distance sampling methods. The high \ndensity of whales indicated that this offshore bank slope is an important \nspring habitat for minke whales in the North Sea. In total, 77 sightings of \nminke whales comprising 130 individuals were recorded. The peak density \nof minke whales was estimated to be 0.029 whales km–2 (minimum \nestimate, 95% CI: 0.012 to 0.070) in May. During peak abundance, the minke \nwhales temporarily congregated in the area, suggesting that the whales \nwere taking advantage of the local spring abundance of sandeels. The \ndensity found was higher than previous studies have suggested for the\ncentral North Sea. The results correspond to recent observations of minke \nwhale redistribution within the North Sea, and these may be related to a \ndecline in sandeel availability elsewhere in the North Sea. Offshore banks \nthat aggregate prey may therefore become increasingly important feeding \nhabitats for minke whales and other top predators in the North Sea. The \nobserved habitat preference of minke whales along this offshore bank \nappeared to be similar to that observed in coastal areas, and this suggests \nsome degree of generality regarding the preference for this type of habitat.\n\nPurpose:\nAs part of a geophysical seismic survey, marine mammals observations were \ncarried out from three vessels: one seismic vessel, one supply vessel operating \nwell ahead from the seismic vessel. The third vessel, MV ‘Andfjord’, carried out \na dedicated Line Transect (LT) survey (23 April to 17 May).  The LT vessel was \nsurveying at distances of ≥20 km away from the geophysical vessel and \nfollowed predetermined line transects placed randomly in a zigzag pattern in \nthe central (German) part of the survey area.",

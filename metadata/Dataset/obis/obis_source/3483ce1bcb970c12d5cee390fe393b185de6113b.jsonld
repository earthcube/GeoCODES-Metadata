The station abuts 65 km of pristine coastline at the southern end of the Ningaloo Reef and Ningaloo Marine Park.The beaches at Gnaraloo Station provide nesting habitat for predominantly loggerhead (Caretta caretta), some green (Chelonia mydas) and possibly hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata) turtles generally from November to March each year.  The Gnaraloo Turtle Conservation Program (GTCP) (www.gnaraloo.com/conservation www.gnaraloo.org   Facebook) has conducted scientific monitoring of turtle activity at rookeries on the Gnaraloo coastline since 2008.The nesting range of loggerhead turtles in Western Australia extends from Dirk Hartog Island in the south to the Muiron Islands in the north, with important rookeries in-between including Gnaraloo Bay, Gnaraloo Cape Farquhar, Janes Bay and Bungelup in the Ningaloo Marine Park.  With loggerhead turtles also being satellite tagged at Dirk Hartog Island and South Muiron Island during the season 2015/16 (1 July 2015 â€“ 30 June 2016), the satellite tagging at Gnaraloo by the GTCP forms part of a broader co-ordinated program to understand inter-nesting movements, post-nesting migrations, and identify foraging grounds and potential threats across the turtles' entire nesting range in Western Australia.   \n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=1149\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

    "description": "Original provider:\nNorth Carolina Aquariums\n\nDataset credits:\nData provider\nNC Aquariums Cold Stunned Sea Turtle Monitoring\nOriginating data center\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/\">Satellite Tracking and Analysis Tool (STAT)</a>\nProject sponsor or sponsor description\nThis project is supported by the Triad Foundation\n\n\nAbstract:\nEvery year, cold-stunned sea turtles strand on North Carolina beaches.  Rehabilitation centers, including the North Carolina Aquariums, assist the rescue effort by providing care and returning these animals to good health.  These turtles are then released offshore into the warm waters of the Gulf Stream, and this project aims to understand where young green turtles go and how they fare in this environment after recovering from cold stunning.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=705\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

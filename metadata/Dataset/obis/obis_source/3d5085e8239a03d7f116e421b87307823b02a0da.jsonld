    "description": "The Arctic Laboratories were commissioned to undertake a combined chemical, biological and physical oceanographic survey from March 1981 to April 1982 in the vicinity of the Issungnak O-61 artificial island. Because of its position near the 20m depth contour, the island provided an ideal opportunity to study oceanographic features in a transitional zone between the more truly marine waters of the outer shelf and Mackenzie River dominated water of shallower nearshore regions.  \n\nThis resource contains species presence information collected during benthic macroinvertebrate surveys conducted concurrently with the oceanographic parameters at the same three stations around Issungnak from June 1981 to April 1982.",

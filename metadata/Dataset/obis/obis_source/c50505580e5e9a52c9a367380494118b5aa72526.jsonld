    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nNOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC)\n\nAbstract:\nDuring 27 June–25 August 2016, the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) conducted a shipboard abundance survey targeting marine mammals, sea turtles and seabirds on the NOAA ship Henry B. Bigelow. The survey area was between 36 and 42N and 65 and 74W, covering waters offshore of the 100m depth contour. There were 2 independent teams targeting marine mammals and sea turtles using line transect sampling techniques, a team targeting targeting sea birds using strip transect sampling techniques, a team monitoring a towed hydrophone array, and a team collecting physical and biological oceanographic data. Track lines were covered at about 10 knots. In Beaufort sea states of six and less, about 5354 km of on-effort track lines were surveyed. Over 1200 groups (16,000 individuals) of cetaceans, 26 groups (27 individuals) of sea turtles and 1977 groups (4677 individuals) of seabirds were recorded.\n\nPurpose:\nThe main objectives of the survey were: 1) determine the distribution and abundance of cetaceans, sea turtles and sea birds within the study area; 2) collect vocalizations of cetaceans using passive acoustic arrays; 3) determine the distribution and relative abundance of plankton and other trophic levels, 4) collect hydrographic and meteorological data, and 5) when possible, collect biopsy samples and photo-identification pictures of cetaceans.\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2022-10-14] The species for the record on 2016-06-30 (group size 160) was corrected from unidentified spotted dolphin to the spinner dolphin.\n\nPerpendicular distance to the animal is not publicly available.

    "description": "Original provider:\nInstituto del Mar del Perú (IMARPE)\n\nDataset credits:\nInstituto del Mar del Perú (IMARPE)\n\nAbstract:\nThis dataset presents killer whale records off Peru taken\nduring 23 pelagic surveys conducted by the Instituto del\nMar del Peru (IMARPE). Sightings data were collected during three kinds of surveys conducted by IMARPE between 1995 and 2003:\n1) Pelagic surveys for evaluating the Peruvian anchovy\n(<i>Engraulis ringens</i>) population, and other pelagic\nresources, covering the entire Peruvian Sea, from the\ncoastline to 200n.m. offshore;\n2) Demersal surveys to evaluate the hake (<i>Merluccius gayi</i>) population off Northern Peru; and\n3) oceanographic surveys to monitor ocean conditions covering the entire Peruvian sea out to 300 nm offshore.\n\nPurpose:\nRecords of the killer whale (<i>Orcinus orca</i>) in Peruvian\nwaters are scarce and mostly anecdotal. Despite reports\nof many artisanal fishermen of occasional sightings of\nkiller whales, these records have not been confirmed,\nresulting in a limited number of reliable reports of this\nspecies off Peru during the last century. To date, no records\nof strandings of killer whales are known for Peru. Due\nto the high concentration of its potential prey (cetaceans\nand pinnipeds) in the Peruvian waters this species would be expected to be more common than previously recorded.",

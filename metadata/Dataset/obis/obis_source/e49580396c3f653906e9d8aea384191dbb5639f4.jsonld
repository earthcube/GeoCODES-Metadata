    "description": "Original provider:\nMohammad Sadeghsaba\n\nDataset credits:\nMarine &amp; Wetlands Division, Department Of the Environment\n\nAbstract:\nThe habitat specialist Indian Ocean humpback dolphin (Sousa plumbea) is \nthe second most common cetacean in the Persian Gulf. Mousa Bay in the \nnorthwestern Persian Gulf is an important, but highly industrialised habitat \nfor this species. We developed a systematic and comprehensive distance \nsampling survey carried out from 2014 to 2016 to estimate abundance and \npopulation density of humpback dolphin in this bay. To evaluate \ndistribution pattern of the species, eight environmental variables were \nmeasured and employed in a zero-inflated generalised additive model \n(ZINB GAM). With an estimated abundance of 92 animals (64–131, 95% CI) \nand density of 0.123 animal / km2 (0.086–0.176, 95% CI), our results \nrevealed Mousa Bay as one of the largest population of humpback dolphin \nin northern latitudes of its global range.\n\nPurpose:\n- Studying the abundance, distribution and zoning of dolphin habitats in the \ncoastal waters of Khuzestan\n- Collecting and producing information about the environmental, \necological, and human characteristics and the most important factors of \nthreats and pressure on the humpback dolphin.\n- Obtaining demographic information of the species such as group size and \nproportion of newborns\n- Obtaining information on the abundance and probability of seeing the \nspecies in the study area for use in ecotourism purposes\n\nSupplemental information:\nObservation time was not provided.\nObservations before and after the project implementation period (2014-2016) \nare also presented.\nRegistered as part of the International Marine Mammal Area under the title \n\"NORTHERN GULF AND CONFLUENCE OF THE TIGRIS, EUPHRATES, AND KURAN \nIMMA\"",

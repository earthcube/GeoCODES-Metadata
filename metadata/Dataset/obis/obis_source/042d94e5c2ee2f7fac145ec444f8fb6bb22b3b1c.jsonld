    "name": "eDNA samples from the gut content and gut lining of Lanternfish for DNA metabarcoding using Nanopore short-read sequencing method along the 110°E meridian Second International Indian Ocean Expedition (IIOE-2) expedition RV Investigator voyage IN2019_V03 (2019)",
    "description": "Lanternfish samples were collected during the 2nd International Indian Ocean Expedition (https://iioe-2.incois.gov.in/), on board a 94 m oceanographic research vessel (RV Investigator, CSIRO, Hobart, Tasmania), which took place between 13 May 2019 and 14 June 2019. This study uses the gut (content and lining) from juvenile lanternfish (Hygophum) specimens to compare the short-read sequencing capability of the portable Nanopore MinION with the Illumina MiSeq. Primers common in dietary DNA metabarcoding work (COI “Leray primers” and 18S rRNA V4 “Zhan primers”) were used, with an additional comparison of cost-effective COI “Lobo primers” (targeting the same COI fragment) for the proficiency in species detection of a broad range of taxa.\nSupplimentary data available at https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1002%2Fedn3.374&amp;file=edn3374-sup-0001-supinfo.xlsx. All data analyses was done using R v4.1.0 script available at https://auckland.figshare.com/articles/online_resource/Short-read_DNA_metabarcoding_using_Nanopore/21482826\nVoyage details (metadata, projects, other datasets either online or as downloads, publications and reports, events, maps etc) can be accessed at https://www.marine.csiro.au/data/trawler/survey_details.cfm?survey=IN2019_V03\nIf this data has been used in any products, please acknowledge with the following: We acknowledge the use of the CSIRO Marine National Facility (https://ror.org/01mae9353) in undertaking this research.\n\n",

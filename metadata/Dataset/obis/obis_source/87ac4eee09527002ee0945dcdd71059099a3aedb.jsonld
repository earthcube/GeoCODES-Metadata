    "description": "Original provider:\nIslameta Group, University of Pisa\n\nDataset credits:\nData provider\nIslameta Group, Dept. of Biology - University of Pisa\nOriginating data center\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/\">Satellite Tracking and Analysis Tool (STAT)</a>\nProject partner\nParco Regionale della Maremma (Maremma Regional Park)\nProject sponsor or sponsor description\nOsservatorio Toscano Cetacei e Tartarughe (Tuscan Observatory Cetaceans and Turtles)\n\n\nAbstract:\nCARESAT is a project funded by the Tuscany Region (Italy) aiming to use satellite telemetry to increase the limited information currently available on the movements of loggerhead turtles frequenting Tuscany waters and the Pelagos Marine Sanctuary. To this aim, turtles found in Tuscan waters and rehabilitated in Tuscan rescue centers will be equipped with satellite transmitters, to reconstruct the movements made by tracked individuals, to identify the areas of the Sanctuary that are mainly frequented, and to reveal hitherto unknown aspects of their ecology and behavior.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=1050\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

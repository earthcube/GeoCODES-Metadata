    "description": "Lancaster Sound mooring data has been used to monitor the oceanographic fluxes existing in the Arctic Ocean and to determine ocean and ice statistics for marine shipping and offshore development. As in other Arctic regions, this is the only means to monitor oceanographic and pack ice seasonal and inter-annual variability and supported annually by Canadian Coast Guard icebreakers. Specific unique instrumentation were designed and built to obtain this sparse data set and represent an required data input to ecosystem-based management, climate studies and navigation safety. Important data source for Ecosystem based Management, for Climate studies and for navigation safety. Plankton samples were collected as part of this program to characterize the water masses flowing from the Arctic Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean.",

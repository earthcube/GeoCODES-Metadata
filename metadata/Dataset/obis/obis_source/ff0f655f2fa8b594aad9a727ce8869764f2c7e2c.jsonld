    "description": "The data is the quantitative abundance of fish derived from underwater visual census methods involving transect counts at rocky reef sites around Tasmania. This data forms part of a larger dataset that also surveyed megafaunal invertebrate abundance and algal cover for the area. The aggregated dataset allows examination of changes in Tasmanian shallow reef floral and faunal communities over a decadal scale - initial surveys were conducted in 1992-1995, and again at the same sites in 2006-2007. There are plans for ongoing surveys\nThe originating metadata record http://metadata.imas.utas.edu.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/metadata.show?uuid=caf7220a-19e0-4a7f-9af6-eade6c79a47a contains project details, additional contacts and on-line resources.",

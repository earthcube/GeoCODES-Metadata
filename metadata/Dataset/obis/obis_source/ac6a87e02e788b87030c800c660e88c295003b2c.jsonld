    "description": "Original provider:\nDuke / UNC Oceanographic Consortium\n\nDataset credits:\nDuke University Marine Laboratory\n\nAbstract:\nThe Duke / University of North Carolina Oceanographic Consortium supported a four-day exploratory cruise off North Carolina in August 2004, to survey physical and biological properties in the vicinity of the cold-core eddies which form along the inner edge of the Gulf Stream. This cruise was the result of a collaborative proposal assembled by Richard Barber, Andy Read, Larry Crowder, David Johnston, Veronica Lance, and David Hyrenbach.   \n\nPurpose:\nThis cruise surveyed marine bird and mammal distributions in the vicinity on the shelf-slope off North Carolina, in an area influenced by the Gulf Stream and by cold-core eddies. \n\nMarine bird and mammal sightings were recorded continuously, while the vessel sailed during daylight hours. The position of the vessel was also recorded every 10 seconds directly from a GPS using the Logger 2000 software, which is publicly available on the internet from the <a href=\"http://www.ifaw.org\">International Fund for Animal Welfare</a>.\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2020-09-30] The following invalid species names were corrected according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS).\nSooty Tern: Sterna fuscata (176894) =&gt; Onychoprion fuscatus (824105)",

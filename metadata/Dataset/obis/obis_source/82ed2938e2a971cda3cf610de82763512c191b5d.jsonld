Hubard, NOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center\n\nAbstract:\nA continental shelf cetacean survey in northern Gulf of Mexico was conducted  in 1998 by NOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center and Minerals Management Service to examine the distribution and estimate abundance of cetaceans in U.S. waters. This dataset contains sightings of not only cetaceans but also other species including sea turtles, fish and shark observed during the ship survey.\n\nDuring the 6 survey days, 42 cetacean groups were sighted, including\n\nAtlantic spotted dolphin\nBottlenose dolphin\nPilot whale\n\nThe dataset  is accompanied by transect data which is provided as a separate file.\n\nPurpose:\nThe purpose of this survey is to examine the distribution and estimate abundance of cetaceans in U.S. waters.\nSpecific objectives of this survey are:\n\n1. Collect line-transect data to estimate abundance and define distribution of cetacean species in continental shelf waters of the northern Gulf of Mexico.\n\n2. Obtain biopsy samples of skin and blubber from selected cetacean species for genetic and contaminant analysis in order to study the stock structure of Gulf of Mexico cetaceans.\n\n3. Collect ichthyoplankton samples with bongo and neuston gear for Gulf-wide estimates of abundance, frequency of occurrence, and distribution of larval and small juvenile king and Spanish mackerel, red drum, snappers, and other taxa.\n\n4. Collect associated environmental data at designated stations in order to define cetacean habitats.\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2020-09-30] The following invalid species names were corrected according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS).\nCaspian Tern: Sterna caspia (176924) =&gt; Hydroprogne caspia (176935)\nLaughing Gull: Larus atricilla (176837) =&gt; Leucophaeus atricilla (824079)\nRoyal Tern: Sterna maxima (176922) =&gt; Thalasseus maximus (824142)\nSandwich Tern: Sterna sandvicensis (176927) =&gt; Thalasseus sandvicensis (176932)",

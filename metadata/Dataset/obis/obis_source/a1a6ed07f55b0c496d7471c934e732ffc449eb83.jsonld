    "description": "Bedford Basin is a marine embayment encircled by the municipality of Halifax region, which is the most highly populated area in the Canadian Atlantic zone. In 1991, a time series was established to record the weekly state of the plankton ecosystem in this basin. The strategy of regular and perpetual sampling provides data to assess environmental variability at the weekly, monthly, seasonal, annual and decadal time scales.",

    "description": "Original provider:\nHDR Environmental, Operations and Construction, Inc.\n\nDataset credits:\nThe U.S. Navy Marine Species Monitoring Program\n\nAbstract:\nA combination of visual line-transect survey, photo-\nidentification (photo-ID), and automated acoustic \nmonitoring methods was used to gather important baseline \ninformation on the occurrence, distribution, and density \nof marine mammals near Naval Station Norfolk (NSN) and \nadjacent areas. The study area was designed to cover areas \nwhere United States Navy activity is substantial, \nincluding Chesapeake Bay waters near NSN and Joint \nExpeditionary Base Little Creek-Fort Story, as well as a \nMine Exercise (MINEX) Area (W-50) in the Atlantic Ocean \noff the coast of Virginia Beach, Virginia. Sixty-one line-\ntransect surveys were completed in two zones (INSHORE and \nMINEX) between August 2012 and August 2015, with 6,550 \nkilometers (km) and 349.6 hours completed on-effort. The \nmajority of sightings were of bottlenose dolphins \n(Tursiops truncatus), although humpback whales (Megaptera \nnovaeangliae), harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena), and \nshort-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) were also \nsighted in the study area on occasion. In addition, \nloggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta), leatherback sea \nturtles (Dermochelys coriacea), and a Kempâ€™s ridley sea \nturtle (Lepidochelys kempii) were sighted during surveys. \nConventional line-transect analysis of bottlenose dolphin \nsightings showed both spatial and seasonal variation in \ndensity and abundance, with greatest density in the \nINSHORE zone during fall months. Densities in the INSHORE \nzone were calculated as 3.88 individuals per square \nkilometer (km2) (abundance[N]=1,203) in fall, 0.63 \nindividuals per km2 (N=195) in winter, 1.00 individuals \nper km2 (N=311) in spring, and 3.55 individuals per km2 \n(N=1,101) in summer. Densities in the MINEX zone were \ncalculated as 2.14 individuals per km2 (N=1,277) in fall, \n0.06 individuals per km2 (N=37) in winter, 1.53 \nindividuals per km2 (N=913) in spring, and 1.39 \nindividuals per km2 (N=829) in summer. Twenty-seven photo-\nID surveys were completed, and a photo-ID catalog was \ncreated using photos taken during both dedicated photo-ID \nand line-transect surveys through May 2014; it contains \n878 identified individuals to date. Subsequent photos will \ncontinue to be added and analyzed. One hundred ten \nindividuals were re-sighted; however, most re-sightings \nwere less than 4 months and 30 km apart. Additional survey \neffort and further analysis will be required before any \nclear movement patterns can be determined. C-POD acoustic \ndata-loggers were initially deployed at four sites \nthroughout the study area to cover areas of high United \nStates Navy activity. Bottlenose dolphins were detected in \neach deployment location during all deployments from \nAugust 2012 to December 2015. Though deployments did not \nprovide consistent coverage in all seasons for all sites \ndue to loss of gear, results from two deployment sites \nnearest to NSN showed a greater level of occurrence during \nfall months, and a diel pattern of occurrence with \nincreased detections during nighttime hours for three \ndeployment sites.\n\nPurpose:\nThe HDR Marine Species Monitoring (MSM) Team was tasked to \ninitiate a monitoring project in coastal waters around \nNSN, JEB-LC, JEB-FS, and the Virginia Beach waterfront, \nincluding the VACAPES MINEX W-50 training area. The main \nobjective is to provide quantitative data and information \non the seasonal occurrence, distribution, and density of \nmarine mammals. Effort was dedicated to working with local \nresearchers and employing proven marine mammal monitoring \nand research techniques to accomplish the following:\n\n1. Conduct monthly systematic line-transect surveys to \ndetermine distribution of marine mammals in the vicinity \nof NSN, JEB-LC, JEB-FS, and the MINEX W-50 area.\n\n2. Conduct monthly photo-identification (photo-ID) surveys \nduring summer months to determine the site fidelity and \ndistributional patterns of marine mammals utilizing the \nareas listed above.\n\n3. Supplement visual surveys by deploying and retrieving \nfour C-POD acoustic recording devices to monitor for \ndolphin echolocation clicks in specific locations.\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2019-08-27] New data were appended and some columns with \nempty values were removed. The dataset name is changed by \ndropping the time period part.\n\nThis dataset includes sightings from photo-id surveys. No \nimages and information on individual animals are provided.\n\nThis dataset includes a subset of the data collection for \nthe Norfolk-VABeach Vessel surveys.\nOther data of the collection are available in the \nfollowing datasets:\n<a href=\"http://seamap.env.duke.edu/dataset/1071\">Norfolk/VA Beach Inshore Vessel Surveys \nNov 2012- Nov 2013</a>\n<a href=\"http://seamap.env.duke.edu/dataset/1072\">Norfolk/VA Beach MINEX Vessel Surveys</a>\n\nAll the US Navy-funded survey datasets are found in the <a href=\"http://seamap.env.duke.edu/partner/NAVY\">OBIS-SEAMAP US Navy</a> page.",

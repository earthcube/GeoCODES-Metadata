    "description": "Historic seabird observations from Hobart to Adelaide via a summer upwelling region nera Cape Portland observed and recorded by the ornithologist John Hatch. Observations typically over a ten minute period multiple times per day. Location and weather details (sea temperature, salinity, water depth and wnd speed and direction) were recorded at the start period. Original data recording sheets can be downloaded at https://www.marine.csiro.au/data/trawler/download.cfm?file_id=5467. Data entered by OBIS Australia and where possible matched to WoRMS taxa.

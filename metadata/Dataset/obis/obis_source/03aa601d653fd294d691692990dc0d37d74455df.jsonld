    "description": "This resources was created as part of a data digitization project. A list of reports published primarily in the 1970s containing species distribution records collected as part of sampling programs in estuaries around the Bay of Fundy by D. Wildish was compiled.  \n\nVersion 1 of this resource contains species presence information for three locations in New Brunswick: Saint John Harbour, the St. Croix and Musquash estuaries. This project of data recovery is on-going and we expect that version 2 of this dataset will contain many more records expanding the temporal, spatial and taxonomic extents of this resource.\n\nThe 'Wildish collection' acknowledges not just one person but an entire team. The sample collection and  analysis could not have been completed without the help of many assistants including skillful seamen. Samples were collected using 0.1m2 Smith-McIntyre grab having a 16cm effective digging depth.",

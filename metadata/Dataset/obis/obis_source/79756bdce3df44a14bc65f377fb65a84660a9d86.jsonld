    "description": "When the Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center established the Coral Reef Ecosystems Division (CRED) in 2001, the Center initiated a program to extend habitat mapping in the U.S. Pacific Islands into deeper water that cannot be readily mapped using satellite and aerial techniques. Since that time NOAA Fisheries has led the effort to map these deeper reefs using ship-based acoustic mapping systems, coupled with video and still-camera observations. These sonar and optical data are combined with the IKONOS-based data products and oceanographic information to provide integrated products that describe the benthic habitats of the Pacific Islands.",

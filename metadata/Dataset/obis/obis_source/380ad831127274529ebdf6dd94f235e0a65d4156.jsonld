    "description": "Original provider:\nHDR Environmental, Operations and Construction, Inc.\n\nDataset credits:\nThe U.S. Navy Marine Species Monitoring Program\n\nAbstract:\nFeatures in this feature class represent animal sightings recorded during aerial monitoring surveys for marine mammals and sea turtles performed in February 2014 in the Hawaii Range Complex (HRC). Aerial surveys were conducted in conjunction with the Submarine Commanderâ€™s Course (SCC) naval training event in HRC on the Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF) Barking Sands Tactical Underwater Range and Barking Sands Underwater Range Extension between Kauai and Niihau, Hawaii during the period 18 February through 20 February 2014. The SCC training event occurred from 17 to 20 February 2014, in waters adjoining Kauai and Niihau, and involved surface ships, submarines, and aircraft. The approach involved flying elliptical-shaped patterns in advance of the cruiser (CG), which extended from the front of the ship (approximately 200 meters) out to approximately 2,500 meters over a width of 5 km. The survey platform was a small fixed-wing Aero Commander 500. Work was performed under HDR task order KB26 (IDIQ contract award N62470-10-D-3011, NAVFAC LANT).",

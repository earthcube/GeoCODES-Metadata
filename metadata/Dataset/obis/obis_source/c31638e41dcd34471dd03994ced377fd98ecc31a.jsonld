    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nNOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC)\n\nAbstract:\nThe survey was conducted on the R/V ABEL-J from 28 July to 31 August 1999.  It started and returned in Woods Hole, MA.  The southern border of the study area was Muscungus Bay, Maine, the northern border was north of Grand Manan Island, Nova Scotia, and the eastern border was Liverpool, Nova Scotia.\n\nPurpose:\nPrimary objectives of the survey were:   (1) determine the spatial distribution and abundance of harbor porpoises,  (2) determine the spatial distribution and abundance of other strategic species, such as white-sided dolphins, minke whales, fin whales, humpback whales and right whales.\n\nSecondary objectives were:  (1) to investigate if a porpoise acoustic detection system, developed by the International Friends for Animal Welfare (IFAW), can passively detect  the location of porpoises, which then can be used to improve the abundance estimate of the harbor porpoises, (2) to compare the distribution and abundance of cetaceans with water depth, temperature, salinity, zooplankton and phytoplankton distribution, (3) obtain biopsy samples of cetaceans.\n\nSupplemental information:\nIn addition to the sighting data, effort data was recorded  every half hour or whenever conditions change.\nThis dataset, therefore, should be used with the effort data.",

    "description": "Original provider:\nDaniel Costa\n\nDataset credits:\nData provider\nCosta Lab Mammals\nOriginating data center\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/\">Satellite Tracking and Analysis Tool (STAT)</a>\n\n\nAbstract:\nDan Costa's Lab at the University of California Santa Cruz is engaged in a long-term tracking study of northern elephant seals at Ano Nuevo State Reserve.  With the help of many graduate students and collaborators, we are investigating a diversity of topics including:  habitat-use, foraging ecology, fine-scale behavior, toxin loading, diving physiology, climate change, and ontogeny.We have a diverse team, but welcome additional collaborators.  Please contact us if you have interesting ideas for analyses\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=573\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

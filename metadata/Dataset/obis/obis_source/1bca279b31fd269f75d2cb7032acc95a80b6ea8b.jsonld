    "description": "This dataset was acquired on the RV Investigator voyage IN2015_V03. The aim was to compare the phytoplankton (prokaryotic and eukaryotic) biomass, diversity of pigments and other molecular markers and biogeochemical functions across coastal, East Australian Current (EAC) and frontal eddy water masses. Full details of data, reports and publications of the voyage is at http://www.marine.csiro.au/data/trawler/survey_details.cfm?survey=IN2015_V03\nNote on data download/processing:\nData downloaded from Australian Microbiome Initiative via Bioplatforms Australia Data Portal on 17 June 2022. The search filter applied to download data from Bioplatforms Australia Data portal are stored in the Darwin Core property (identificationRemarks). Taxonomy is assigned according to the taxonomic database (SILVA 138) and method (Sklearn) which is stored in the Darwin Core Extension\nDNA derived data property (otu_db). Prefix were removed from the taxonomic names as shown in the example (e.g. d__Bacteria to Bacteria). Scientific name is assigned to the valid name available from the highest taxonomic rank.\nThis collection is published as Darwin Core Occurrence, so the event level measurements need to be replicated for every occurrence. Instead of data replication, the event level eMoF data are made available separately at https://www.marine.csiro.au/data/services/obisau/emof_export.cfm?ipt_resource=bioplatforms_mm_in2015_v03",

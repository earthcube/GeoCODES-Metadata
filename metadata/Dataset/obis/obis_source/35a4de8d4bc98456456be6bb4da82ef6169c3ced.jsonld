    "description": "Original provider:\nCaroline Weir\n\nDataset credits:\nCaroline Weir, Ketos Ecology\nKaren Stockin, Sea Watch Foundation\n\nAbstract:\nSpatial and temporal trends in the distribution of the harbor porpoise <i>Phocoena phocoena</i>, white-beaked dolphin <i>Lagenorhynchus albirostris</i>, and minke whale <i>Balaenoptera acutorostrata</i> were assessed at a coastal North Sea study area in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. Between March 1999 and October 2001, cetacean data were collected using both land- and vessel-based survey methods. A total of 174 sightings of these three cetacean species was recorded during approximately 330 h of combined survey effort (228 h land-based and 102 h vessel-based).\n\nPurpose:\nThe data were collected to analyze the distribution and seasonality of cetacean species in the region, in order to provide recommendations for their long-term conservation and management.\n\nSupplemental information:\nThis dataset is accompanied with a <a href=\"http://seamap.env.duke.edu/datasets/detail/425\">vessel survey</a>, a separate dataset available on OBIS-SEAMAP.\nMost survey efforts were conducted on shore-based platforms, hence they are represented as points on the map while a few are represented as lines where observers moved around during the surveys.",

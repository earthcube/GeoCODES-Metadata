    "description": "Original provider:\nDuke University Marine Laboratory\n\nDataset credits:\nNicholas School of  the Environment and Earth Sciences, Duke University\n\nAbstract:\nThis dataset contains locational information of marine mammal, sea bird, sea turtle sightings off of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, in August, 2004.\n\nPurpose:\nhttp://www.whoi.edu/science/PO/hatterasfronts/marinemammal.html\n\nOur objective is to map the distribution of upper-trophic predators with respect to physical and biological gradients across the NC shelf. A team of observers used standardized population sampling techniques, including line-transect and strip transect methods, to survey the distribution and abundance of marine mammals, birds and turtles. By repeatedly surveying the study area in conjunction with physical and biological measurements from in-situ and remote-sensing platforms, we will quantify how these predators respond to changes in the oceanography of this dynamic region over short time scales (days) and across seasons (summer - winter).\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2020-09-30] The following invalid species names were corrected according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS).\nBonaparte's Gull: Larus philadelphia (176839) =&gt; Chroicocephalus philadelphia (824040)\n\n\nWhere Current Collide website: http://www.whoi.edu/science/PO/hatterasfronts/index.html\n\nIn addition to the sighting data, effort data and environmental data were recorded.\nThis dataset, therefore, should be used with the effort data.",

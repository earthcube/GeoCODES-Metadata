    "description": "Original provider:\nFlorida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, Fish and Wildlife Research Institute, Marine Turtle Research Program\n\nDataset credits:\nBlair Witherington, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission - Fish and Wildlife Research Institute\nRobert Hardy, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission - Fish and Wildlife Research Institute\n\nAbstract:\nThese data describe observations of subadult and adult sea turtles that were observed by Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) staff ancillary to a study of the ecology of neonate sea turtles inhabiting epipelagic drift communities of the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Animals were observed by researchers aboard an 8.2 m power catamaran vessel launched from four ports along the west coast of Florida (Pensacola, Apalachicola, Sarasota, and Marco Island), United States. Researchers observed aggregations of loggerheads in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, off Florida's west coast, during twelve sampling trips in August 2005, June 2006, July 2008 and August 2008. Observations of juvenile, subadult and adult loggerheads are rare in this study and considered ancillary as the effort targets posthatchling (&gt; 10 cm straight carapace length) sea turtles inhabiting lines of floating pelagic debris and Sargassum. Loggerhead turtle sizes included three groupings: Adult (&gt; 90 cm SCL), Subadult (45-90 cm SCL), and Juvenile (&lt; 45 cm SCL). During this time 78 loggerheads (<i>Caretta caretta</i>), 1 Kemp's ridley (<i>Lepidochelys kempii</i>), and 2 unidentified turtles were observed. Sea turtle observations were made by two experienced observers who kept watch for sargassum habitat (for neonate studies) and large turtles (to avoid collisions). Vessel paths fanned out from each port to depths up to 300 m, with a mean path approximately perpendicular to the coastline.\n\nPurpose:\nThese data describe the geographic positions of juvenile, subadult, and adult sea turtle observations which were made ancillary to a long-term study of the ecology of neonate sea turtles inhabiting epipelagic drift communities of the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Attributes describe the date of observation, species, age class, latitude, longitude, the distance from transect to observation, and city of the port of departure.\n\nSupplemental information:\nPrior to July 1, 2004, the Fish and Wildlife Research Institute (FWRI) was known as the Florida Marine Research Institute (FMRI). The institute name has not been changed in historical data sets or references to work completed by the Florida Marine Research Institute. The institute name has been changed in references to ongoing research, new research, and contact information.",

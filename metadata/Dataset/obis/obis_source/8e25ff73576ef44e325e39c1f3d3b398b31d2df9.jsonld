    "description": "This resource contains species distribution records extracted from the Fisheries and Oceans Canada BioChem database for the BioChem 'BIO-JGOFS 1992' series of records.  This collection contains zooplankton abundance and distribution information for locations from a cruise transect across the North Atlantic.  Samples were collected from 120 m to the surface using a 75 cm diameter conical net of 202 micron mesh towed vertically through the water column. \n\nSample analysis results were archived in the BioChem database.  This OBIS resource contains a subset of these database records - at this time only abundance information has been released.",

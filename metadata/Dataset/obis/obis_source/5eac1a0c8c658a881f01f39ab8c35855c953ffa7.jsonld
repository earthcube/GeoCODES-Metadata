    "description": "The purpose of this investigation was to examine the temporal and environmental (e.g. temperature, tide height) patterns in the presence and abundance of resident and migratory fishes, as observed in the fish catches at two Minas Basin intertidal weirs during April – August 2013. Sampling was conducted weekly during daytime low tides from weirs in Bramber, NS and Five Islands, NS. Diel patterns were examined during two one-week periods during late July and early August at the Bramber site.  Pelagic fishes, especially those of the Clupeidae family, dominated the catches at both weirs.  Harbour porpoise presence near intertidal weirs was low during summer, especially on the north shore.\nDay/night sampling was conducted on 14 consecutive low tides during 12-19 July at Bramber.  \nOverall, the study showed that intertidal weirs are useful sampling platforms for assessing general patterns in the presence and abundance of fishes in Minas Basin and can strengthen on-going environmental monitoring near tidal energy development sites.\n\nThe purpose of the study was to examine fish catches in intertidal weirs in Minas Basin as a possible analogue for patterns in the abundance of fishes that travel though the Minas Passage and FORCE test area to spawning rivers or to feed in Minas Basin during the spring and summer months. Fish data of interest include species identification, size, and approximate abundance in weir catches during April to September 2013. Weir catch data can be used to examine temporal patterns in the presence and abundance of resident and migratory fishes.",

L., NOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center\n\nAbstract:\nThe second of two spring vessel surveys of the GulfCet II Program was conducted  in 1997 in oceanic and upper continental slope waters of U.S. Gulf of Mexico by NOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center to examine the distribution and estimate abundance of cetaceans in U.S. waters. This dataset contains sightings of not only cetaceans but also other species including sea turtles, fish and shark observed during the ship survey.\n\nDuring the 44 survey days, at least 18 species were sighted, including\n\nBryde's whale\nSperm whale\nDwarf/pygmy sperm whale\nCuvier's beaked whale\nBlainville's beaked whale\nStriped dolphin\nSpinner dolphin\nClymene dolphin\nPantropical spotted dolphin\nAtlantic spotted dolphin\nFraser's dolphin\nBottlenose dolphin\nRough-toothed dolphin\nRisso's dolphin\nKiller whale\nFalse killer whale\nPilot whale\nPygmy killer whale\nMelon-headed whale\n\nThe dataset  is accompanied by transect data which is provided as a separate file.\n\nPurpose:\nThe purpose of this survey is to examine the distribution and estimate abundance of cetaceans in U.S. waters.\n\nSpecific objectives of this survey are:\n\n1. Collect line-transect data to estimate abundances and define the distribution of each cetacean species in oceanic and selected continental shelf waters of the northern Gulf of Mexico.\n\n2. Obtain biopsy samples of skin and blubber from selected cetacean species for genetic and contaminant analysis in order to study the stock structure of Gulf of Mexico cetaceans.\n\n3. collect associated environmental data at designated stations in order to define cetacean habitats.\n\n4. Collect data on the distribution and abundance of seabirds and other marine life.\n\n5. Obtain photographs of selected cetacean species for photo-identification studies.\n\n6. Make recordings of cetacean vocalizations.\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2020-09-30] The following invalid species names were corrected according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS).\nBridled Tern: Sterna anaethetus (176897) =&gt; Onychoprion anaethetus (824104)\nCaspian Tern: Sterna caspia (176924) =&gt; Hydroprogne caspia (176935)\nLaughing Gull: Larus atricilla (176837) =&gt; Leucophaeus atricilla (824079)\nLeast Tern: Sterna antillarum (176923) =&gt; Sternula antillarum (824127)\nRoyal Tern: Sterna maxima (176922) =&gt; Thalasseus maximus (824142)\nSooty Tern: Sterna fuscata (176894) =&gt; Onychoprion fuscatus (824105)",

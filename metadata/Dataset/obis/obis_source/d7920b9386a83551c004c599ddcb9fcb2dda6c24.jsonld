    "description": "Data on the distribution, reproductive and survival rates and abundance of the Lahille's bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus gephyreus, inhabiting the Patos Lagoon estuary and adjacent marine coast have been collected data from August 2005 to December 2018. Data have been acquired systematically and intensively applying direct observation and photo-identification approaches. This temporal data series allowed estimating the reproductive and survival rates of calf, juvenile and adult (females and males) dolphins and total population abundance. Variability in estimates was evaluated based on the continuity of the long-term surveys carried out during this period.",

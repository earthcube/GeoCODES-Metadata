    "description": "This is the first study on the epi- and hyperbenthic fauna of the surf zone of sandy beaches of the Belgian coast. Therefore, as a first objective of this thesis, a lot of attention has been paid to the inventarisation (species composition), and to the investigation of the temporal and spatial distribution patterns of both communities. A temporal and a spatial campaign were performed during which the hyper- and epibenthos was sampled.",

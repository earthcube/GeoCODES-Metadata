    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nNOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC)\n\nAbstract:\nAs part of the AMAPPS program, the Southeast Fisheries \nScience Center conducted aerial surveys of continental \nshelf and slope waters (up to the 2,000 m isobath) along \nthe US east coast from New Jersey to Florida. The survey \nwas conducted during 2017 between 17 April and 20 May \naboard a NOAA Twin Otter aircraft at an altitude of 600 \nfeet (183 m) and a speed of 110 knots. Survey tracklines \nwere oriented perpendicular to the shoreline and \nlatitudinally spaced 20 km apart. “Fine-scale” tracklines \nwere surveyed closer to the shores of NJ, DE and VA over \nrenewable energy leasing areas. The survey was designed \nfor analysis using Distance sampling and a two-team \n(independent observer) approach to correct for perception \nbias in resulting abundance estimates.\n\nPurpose:\nThe goal of the survey was to conduct line-transect surveys \nusing the Distance sampling approach to estimate the \nabundance and spatial distribution of cetaceans and turtles \nin waters over the continental shelf and slope (shoreline \nto 2,000 m isobath) of the eastern USA.\n\nSupplemental information:\nPerpendicular distance to the animal is not publicly \navailable.\nThe dataset is accompanied by transect (effort) data \nwhich is provided as a separate file.\nSightings included were detected on-effort by the forward \nteam only; you may request the full dataset and sightings \nincluding opportunistic ones directly to the provider.\nEnvironmental Attribute Codes\nBeaufort Sea state\n0 Calm, mirror like seas\n1 Waves &lt;1ft, rippled surface\n2 Small wavelets (&lt;2 ft), no white caps\n3 Large wavelets (&lt;3ft), scattered white caps\n4 Swell 3-4 ft, numerous white caps\n5 Swell &gt;5 ft, many white caps, some spray\n6 Swell &gt;10 ft, white caps everywhere, spray\nCloudCover\n0 Clear\n1 0-25% Cloudy\n2 26-50% Cloudy\n3 51-75% Cloudy\n4 76-100% Cloudy\n5 Overcast\nGlare (Glare intensity)\n0 No Impairment\n1 Slight Impairment\n2 Moderate Impairment\n3 Severe Impairment\nWeather\n0 Clear\n1 Mist\n2 Light Rain\n3 Heavy Rain\nConditions\n0 Poor\n1 Fair\n2 Moderate\n3 Good\n4 Excellent\nHaze\n0 No\n1 Yes\nFog\n0 No\n1 Yes\nSun penetration (Sun pen)\n0 Poor\n1 Fair\n2 Good\n3 Excellent\nTurbidity\n0 Poor\n1 Fair\n2 Good\n3 Excellent",

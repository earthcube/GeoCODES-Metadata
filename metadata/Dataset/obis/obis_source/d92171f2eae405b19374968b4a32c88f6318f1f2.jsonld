    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nNOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center\n\nAbstract:\nThe Pacific Islands Cetacean Ecosystem Assessment Survey was a line-transect survey for cetaceans was conducted within the Palmyra exclusive economic zone (EEZ) (23 April - 17 May 2012). The set of standard tracklines surveyed was established prior to the cruise and was intended to cover approximately two thirds of the Palmyra Atoll EEZ transect line grid used for the 2005 Pacific Islands Cetacean Ecosystem and Assessment (PICEAS; AR-05-07) survey. This survey was a continuation of PICEAS 2011. There were 48 cetacean sightings including 11 identified species and three types of unidentified cetaceans.\n\nSupplemental information:\nData were collected under NMFS permit 14097.\nThe data included here are the sightings and on-effort tracks recorded within WinCruz survey software and extracted from the QA/QC'd DAS file using the R package swfscDAS (https://smwoodman.github.io/swfscDAS).\n\nAttributes for fields within the trackline files:\nCruise - see description in attribute table below\nsegnum - segment number for continuous on-effort line\nDate - Local date m/dd/yyyy\nTimeStart - Local time at start of on-effort segment\nLatStart - Latitude in decimal degrees at starting point of on-effort segment\nLongStart - Longitude in decimal degrees at starting point of on-effort segment\nTimeEnd - Local time at end of on-effort segment\nLatEnd - Latitude in decimal degrees at end point of on-effort segment\nLongEnd - Longitude in decimal degrees at end point of on-effort segment\nMode - see description in attribute table below\nEffType - see description in attribute table below\navgSpdKt - average speed (knots) of the ship over the on-effort segment traveled\navgBft - average Beaufort Sea State over the on-effort segment\n\nOther data not included here:\nPhotos and biopsy samples were collected during some sightings. Acoustic detections were recorded from a towed hydrophone array. Sonobuoys were deployed opportunistically. \nA High-frequency Acoustic Recording Package (HARP) was recovered off Kingman Reef. Oceanographic data were collected (CTD, XBT).\n\nSee PIFSC Cetacean Survey, PICEAS 2011, Cruise 1108, NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center for cetacean sightings that occurred during the first portion of this survey effort. Sighting numbers listed here are a continuation of the 2011 survey.",

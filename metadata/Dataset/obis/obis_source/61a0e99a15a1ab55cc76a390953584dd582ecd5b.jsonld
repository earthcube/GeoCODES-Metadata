    "description": "The benthic communities at 33 near shore reefs between Cape Tribulation (16°S) and Keppel Is (23°S) were surveyed in 2004. Prospective near-shore coral reef sampling locations were initially selected from six broad geographic regions of the GBR: Cairns, Innisfail, Townsville, Whitsunday, Mackay, and Keppel. Each of these regions has a unique combination of climatic regime, coastal and shelf topography and the characteristics of adjacent catchments. Where topography allowed, two depths were surveyed at replicate sites at each reef giving a total of 63 locations.\nSurvey reports, methods and additional information are available at https://apps.aims.gov.au/metadata/view/7db747be-b780-4dc2-baf8-9cd4cbbf1a42",

Flipper tagging commenced in February 2008 as well as continuous beach patrols and data collection on the nesting females on Pulau Bangkaru. One of the aspects that is especially relevant to the newly protected rookery of Bangkaru is to know what the entire range of movement is of its nesting turtles. Through satellite tagging Yayasan Pulau Banyak is able to have more insight in the post-nesting migrations and feeding grounds. On June 15 and June 17 2010, the first two sea turtles in Sumatra, have been fitted with a satellite transmitter to track their movements. Maia and Eva will be able to tell us more about post nesting migrations of green turtles off the west coast of Sumatra and in the Eastern Indian Ocean.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=518\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

A small island in the Caribbean, Dominica has several sea turtle species nesting on it's beaches. Leatherbacks have been the main focus due to poaching on the island of adults and nests. Georgia Aquarium and DomSeTCO support patrollers on the main leatherback nesting beaches and has initiated a sea turtle tour program bringing visitors and locals alike to witness sea turtle nesting events on the island.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=996\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

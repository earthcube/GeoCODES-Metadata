McLellan, University of North Carolina Wilmington\n\nAbstract:\nAerial surveys were flown in parallel lines from the South Carolina/North Carolina border to the south end of Assateague Island, Virginia, United States from December 2006 to May 2007. All large whale, small cetaceans, sea turtles and large fish, and ship sightings were recorded. Surveys were conducted in Beaufort sea states of 5 or under and in clear weather conditions. Photos of all large whales exist in the VAB LAB photo data base at University of North Carolina Wilmington (UNCW). UNCW houses a data base that now extends from 1998 to 2007 for aerial surveys conducted in the mid-Atlantic and southeast Atlantic bight.\n\nPurpose:\nTo conduct systematic aerial surveys for large whales, specifically targeting right whales, during winter and spring off North Carolina and Virginia, United States.",

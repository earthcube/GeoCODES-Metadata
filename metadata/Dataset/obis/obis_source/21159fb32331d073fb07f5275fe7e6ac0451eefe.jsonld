In December 2013, a Pendoley Environmental team attached three modern GPS TDR ptt units to green tutles at Barrow Island.  Advances in technology over the intervening 13 years is expected to result in substantial improvements in data quantity and quality relative to the turn of the century program.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=956\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

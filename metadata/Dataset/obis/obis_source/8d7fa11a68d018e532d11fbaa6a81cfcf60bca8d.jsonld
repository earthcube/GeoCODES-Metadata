    "description": "This dataset contains georeferenced information of planktonic amphipods of the suborder Hyperiidea collected in front of the Mexican state of Veracruz, southern Gulf of Mexico, from 29 November to 2 December 2007. Zooplankton sampling was carried out with a Bongo net of 333 and 505 µm mesh size. The sampling grid included 21 oceanographic stations arranged in six transects perpendicular to the coastline. The study area is comprised between 18.84622 to 19.63814 North latitude and 95.28207 to 96.27735 West longitude. In total, the dataset includes 485 records corresponding to 78 species belonging to 34 genera and 16 families.",

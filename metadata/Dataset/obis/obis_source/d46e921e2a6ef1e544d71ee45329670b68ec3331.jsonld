    "description": "The online Fish Collection database includes all relevant information for each cataloged lot of specimens. Please note that slightly over 50% of the holdings are presently listed and records are constantly added. Data included in the Locality field are directly from a collector's field notes or from cruise logs. Geographic retrieval fields added by cataloging staff are based on internally defined criteria and may not be geographically accurate.",

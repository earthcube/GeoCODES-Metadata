    "description": "Original provider:\nLamont-Doherty / LGL\n\nDataset credits:\nLamont-Doherty Earth Observatory\nLGL Limited - Environmental Research Associates\nNational Science Foundation\n\nAbstract:\nMarine geophysical seismic research funded by the NSF includes a marine mammal and sea turtle monitoring and mitigation program. Protected Species Observers record all instances of marine mammals and turtles observed during surveys and while in transit to the survey site. The sightings data are also provided in 90 day reports available online <a href=\"http://www.nsf.gov/geo/oce/envcomp/index.jsp\">here</a>.\n\nPurpose:\nSightings data are collected as part of a marine mammal and sea turtle monitoring program during academic seismic surveys.\n\nSupplemental information:\nWhen the number of animals sighted was not available, it was filled with '1' to be conservative and noted in the Notes field. When the number of animals sighted was a range, the lower estimate was used to be conservative and noted in the Notes field. When the time was not available, it was filled with '00:00:00' and noted in the Notes field.\n7/27/2011: This dataset was updated to include additional sightings and effort.\n8/3/2011: Effort data were updated to fix transects crossing 180/-180 degrees longitude.\n3/7/2012: Sightings were corrected and updated.",

    "description": "The Southern Ocean Time Series (SOTS) observatory and the Subantarctic Mooring site (SAM) lie in the Subantarctic waters south west of Tasmania and south east New Zealand, respectively. The SOTS and SAM sites have been instrumented quasi-continuously with deep-moored sediment traps (≥1000 m deep) since the late 90’s - early 2000s with the main objective of quantifying sinking carbon particle fluxes to the deep sea and for a broad range of biogeochemical studies.\nThe E. huxleyi populations were captured by sediment traps at ~1000, 2000 and 3800 m depth for a year from August 2011 until July 2012 at the SOTS observatory and a sediment trap at ~1500 m depth for a year from November 2009 until November 2010 at the SAM site.\nFull details are in Rigual-Hernández, A.

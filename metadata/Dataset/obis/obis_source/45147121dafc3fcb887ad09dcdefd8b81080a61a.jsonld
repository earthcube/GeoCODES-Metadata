    "description": "The primary objective of this voyage IN2017_V03 was to sample the biodiversity of lower bathyal (2500 m) and abyssal (4000 m) seafloor habitats off south-eastern Australia, and in particular deep-water ecosystems of seven Commonwealth marine reserves.\nData has been sourced from Atlas of Living Australia.\n\nVoyage details (metadata, projects, other datasets either online or as downloads, publications and reports, events, maps etc) can be accessed at https://www.marine.csiro.au/data/trawler/survey_details.cfm?survey=IN2017_V03\nIf this data has been used in any products, please acknowledge with the following: We acknowledge the use of the CSIRO Marine National Facility (https://ror.org/01mae9353) in undertaking this research.\n",

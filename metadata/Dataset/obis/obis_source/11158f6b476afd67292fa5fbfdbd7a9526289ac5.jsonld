    "description": "Very large swarms of the red jellyfish Crambione mastigophora in north-western Australia disrupt swimming on tourist beaches causing economic impacts. In October 2012, jellyfish stranding on Cable Beach (density 2.20 ± 0.43 ind. m-2) was estimated at 52.8 million individuals or 14,172 t wet weight along 15 km of beach. Reports of strandings after this period and up to 250 km south of this location indicate even larger swarm biomass.\nThe data is from Keesing et al. (2016) Role of winds and tides in timing of beach strandings, occurrence, and significance of swarms of the jellyfish Crambione mastigophora Mass 1903 (Scyphozoa: Rhizostomeae: Catostylidae) in north-western Australia.

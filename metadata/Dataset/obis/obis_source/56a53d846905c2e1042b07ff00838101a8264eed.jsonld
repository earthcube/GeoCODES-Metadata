    "description": "Original provider:\nCoastal Research and Education Society of Long Island, Inc.\n\nDataset credits:\nCoastal Research and Education Society of Long Island, Inc.\n\nAbstract:\nThe sightings came originally from the\nOkeanos Ocean Research Foundation (Samuel S. Sadove, executive director; Okeanos is no longer in existence), and were recorded from commercial whale-watching vessels out of Montauk in late spring and summer of 1981â€“1994 (primarily the Finback I and Finback II). These sightings are heavily concentrated in the area between eastern Long Island and Block Island and during the whale-watching season, and therefore somewhat biased, but provide valuable information on several less-common species.\n\nPurpose:\nnot provided\n\nSupplemental information:\nData records that were missing time, animal count information, or located on land were excluded. One data record with two sighted species listed was also excluded.",

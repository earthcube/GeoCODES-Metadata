We deployed 4 satellite transmitters or Platform Terminal Transmitters (PTT?s) on loggerhead sea turtles in July 2003. This has allowed us to track the long distance movements of these turtles and has given insights into migratory and foraging behaviour.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=1\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

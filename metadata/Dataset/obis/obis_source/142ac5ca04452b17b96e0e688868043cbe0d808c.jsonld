    "description": "This spreadsheet provides the sequences counts for the DNA groups found in the scats of black-browed albatross at New Island and Steeple Jason Island, Falkland Islands; Diego Ramírez and Albatross Islet, Chile; Bird Island, South Georgia; Canyon des Sourcils Noirs, Kerguelen Archipelago, France; Macquarie Island, Australia; and Campbell albatross at Campbell Island, NZ.\n\nScat samples were collected in 2013/14 and 2014/15 at New Island, Steeple Jason Island, Macquarie Island, Campbell Island and Bird Island; in 2013/14 and 2015/16 at Kerguelen; in 2014/15 and 2015/16 at Albatross Islet and in 2013/14 at Diego Ramírez. Samples were collected during Incubation (Oct-Nov), early chick-rearing (Dec-Jan) or late-chick rearing (Feb-Mar). Due to the availability of birds at the colony, samples were predominantly collected from adults during incubation and early chick-rearing and chicks during late chick rearing. Samples sizes were too low during this study to directly compare dietary differences between chicks and adults; however, dietary comparisons between breeding stages were examined for sites where samples were collected during multiple breeding stages.\n\nSamples were PCR amplified with a universal metazoan primer set that is highly conserved and amplifies a region of the nuclear small subunit ribosomal DNA gene (18S rDNA).

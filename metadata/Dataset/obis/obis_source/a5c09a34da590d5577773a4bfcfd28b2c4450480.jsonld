    "description": "The Australian Biological Tissue Collection (ABTC) was the first frozen tissue collection in any Australian museum and is one of the largest wildlife tissue collections in the world. This important collection encompasses most vertebrate groups as well as a broad representation of major invertebrate groups from Australia and surrounding regions. It has immense research significance for researchers around the world.\n\nThe ABTC is the largest tissue bank for wildlife research in the Southern Hemisphere. It contains nearly 125,000 animal and plant samples collected from terrestrial and marine animals since 1979.\nThis dataset is of marine species sourced from the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) January 2019 (https://collections.ala.org.au/public/show/co166). Taxa have been matched to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) and if not then matched to the Australian Faunal Directory (AFD)",

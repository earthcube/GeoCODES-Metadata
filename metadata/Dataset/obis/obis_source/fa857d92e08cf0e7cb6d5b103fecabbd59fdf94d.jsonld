    "description": "This papers purpose was to provide information on foraminifera species living in the Canadian Arctic. Samples were collected from the sediment of Hecla and Griper Bay and Hazen Strait, a part of the channel system of the Queen Elizabeth Islands in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. The area represents a high-latitude, partly land-locked marine environment. The samples were collected from the ice surface through seal holes and leads in the ice using Dietz-LaFond bottom grabber and piston corer. Samples were collected from the benthos at depths ranging from 17 metres to 458 metres deep. Foraminifera samples were washed through a 230 mesh sieve dried and weighed and species were inspected for the determination of relative percentages of species present. The OBIS view of this data set includes presence only.\n\nAlso included in the report, but not included in this OBIS view are images of species found at the sampling locations (Vilks,1969).",

    "description": "The purpose of this study was to look at the vertical distribution of all major species of zooplankton in Baffin Bay and Davis Strait, with particular emphasis on chaetognaths and copepods (Calanus species and their copepodites in particular) using fine-scale biological samples and simultaneous temperature and salinity data. This collection includes data collected during two Hudson cruises, one between July 29 to August 3, 1980 and the second between August 7 to August 14, 1983 Plankton samples were collected using the BIONESS sampler equipped with 243u mesh nets. Profiles were from the bottom to the surface. The samples collected were preserved in 4% formaldehyde and later analysed down to species for Copepoda and genus for all other classes and phyla. A wet weight for each group was also measured. Associated chlorophyll, phaeophytin and nutrient data are available.",

    "description": "Original provider:\nHDR Environmental, Operations and Construction, Inc.\n\nDataset credits:\nThe U.S. Navy Marine Species Monitoring Program\n\nAbstract:\nAerial surveys to monitor marine mammals and sea turtles (MM/ST) were conducted in conjunction with a U.S. Commander Pacific Fleet (COMPACFLT) training event in the Hawaii Range Complex (HRC) on the Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF) Barking Sands Tactical Underwater Range (BARSTUR) and Barking Sands Underwater Range Extension (BSURE) between Kauai and Ni'ihau, Hawaii during the period February 15 to 25, 2012.\nSurveys in support of the Submarine Commanderâ€™s Course (SCC) event occurred on 3 consecutive days from February 15 to 17, 2012, in waters adjoining Kauai and Ni'ihau where the missile destroyer (DDG) USS Paul Hamilton and other ships were conducting a training exercise, followed by shoreline surveys of Kauai and Ni'ihau on two separate days thereafter: February 23 and 25, 2012.The survey methods and sampling design were submitted and approved in advance per the statement of work (SOW), to the Navy Technical Representative (NTR) and followed previously established protocol (Mobley 2011, Mobley and Milette 2010, Smultea et al. 2009a,b).\n\nPurpose:\nnot provided\n\nSupplemental information:\nThis dataset includes sightings during the ship-follow surveys.\n\nData for the shoreline surveys are available: <a href=\"http://seamap.env.duke.edu/dataset/927\">HRC SCC Aerial-based Shoreline Surveys February 2012</a>\n\nThe count of the humpback whale sighting at 10:02:10 02/17/12 was originally marked '-' and replaced with a '1' in this dataset.\nThe bearing marked 'mill' was emptied.",

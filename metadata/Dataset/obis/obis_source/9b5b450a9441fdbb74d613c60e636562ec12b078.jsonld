    "description": "Original provider:\nHDR Environmental, Operations and Construction, Inc.\n\nDataset credits:\nThe U.S. Navy Marine Species Monitoring Program\n\nAbstract:\nData in this dataset represent animal sightings recorded during line-transect aerial surveys for marine mammal density in Puget Sound, WA. Aerial surveys were conducted from 16-25 January 2016. Due to errors in recording the GPS, 25 sightings have NULL values for LatAnimal and LongAnimal. Approximate latitude and longitude values can be obtained by matching the timestamp in the effort featureclass, and using LatPlatform/LongPlatform. Similarly, due to observer/data recorder error, several sightings appear to be located on shore. Work was performed under HDR task order KB05 (IDIQ contract award N62470-15-D-8006, NAVFAC LANT).",

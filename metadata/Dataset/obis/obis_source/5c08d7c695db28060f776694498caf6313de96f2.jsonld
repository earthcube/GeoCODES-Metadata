    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nCarol Roden, NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service\n\nAbstract:\nAn Atlantic Ocean ship survey was conducted by NOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center in 1999 to evaluate abundance, distribution and stock structure of cetaceans in southeastern U.S. Atlantic waters. Data gathered on this survey will provide abundance estimates for calculating the Potential Biological Removal for U.S. Atlantic waters as required by the 1994 amendments to the Marine Mammal Protection Act.\n\nDuring the 32 survey days, at least 12 cetacean species were sighted, including\n\nAtlantic spotted dolphin\nBottlenose dolphin\nClymene dolphin\nCommon dolphin\nFraser's dolphin\nMelon-headed whale\nPantropical spotted dolphin\nPilot whale\nRisso's dolphin\nRough-toothed dolphin\nSperm whale\nStriped dolphin\n\nThe dataset  is accompanied by transect data which is provided as a separate file.\n\nPurpose:\nThe purpose of this survey is to examine the distribution and estimate abundance of cetaceans in U.S. waters.\n\nSpecific objectives of this survey are:\n\n1. Obtain minimum abundance estimate for calculating Potential Biological Removal for each species.\n\n2. Collect biopsy tissue samples to evaluate stock structure.\n\n3.Establish and build time-series databases for monitoring trends in abundance.\n\n4. Examine distribution in relation to physiographic and oceanographic features.\n\n5. Obtain photographs and video images of selected species for photo-identification studies.\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2020-09-30] The following invalid species names were corrected according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS).\nBridled Tern: Sterna anaethetus (176897) =&gt; Onychoprion anaethetus (824104)\nCaspian Tern: Sterna caspia (176924) =&gt; Hydroprogne caspia (176935)\nLaughing Gull: Larus atricilla (176837) =&gt; Leucophaeus atricilla (824079)\nRoyal Tern: Sterna maxima (176922) =&gt; Thalasseus maximus (824142)\nSandwich Tern: Sterna sandvicensis (176927) =&gt; Thalasseus sandvicensis (176932)\nSooty Tern: Sterna fuscata (176894) =&gt; Onychoprion fuscatus (824105)",

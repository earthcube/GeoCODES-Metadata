    "description": "The study area was located on the Wenlock and Ducie River systems in Cape York, Queensland, Australia (12.350°S, 142.107°E; The region exhibits a distinct wet season, with monsoonal rains followed by a dry season with little to no rainfall. Both the Ducie and Wenlock Rivers flow into Port Musgrave, a large coastal embayment in the eastern  Gulf of Carpentaria. Being tropical tidal rivers, they are subject to daily fluctuations in salinity and to large increases in freshwater inflow .at the onset of the wet season. \n\nTo investigate long-term broadscale movements compared to the changing water conditions, 22 speartooth sharks (Glyphis glyphis) and 22  bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas)  were fitted with acoustic transmitters and were tracked passively via an array of underwater. acoustic hydrophones.\nTracking data was accessed from the Dryad repository in the cited paper.\n",

    "description": "Original provider:\nColum Muccio, Asociacion Rescate y Conservacion de Vida Silvestres (ARCAS)\n\nDataset credits:\nAsociacion Rescate y Conservacion de Vida Silvestres (ARCAS)\n\nAbstract:\nIn 2011, ARCAS documented the mortality of 39 olive ridley sea turtles in the área of Hawaii on the Pacific coast of Guatemala.  Another mortality of 128 turtlesm occured in 2013 in an área stretching roughly from the resort of Monterrico to the Salvadoran border.  Unlike the 2011 stranding, which was all but one Green, entirely olive ridleys, the 2013 had more of a mix of species, including 113 olive ridleys, 13 greens, 1 hawksbill and 1 leatherback.  at the same time, in neighboring El Salvador, there was a stranding of 190 sea turtles.\n\nSupplemental information:\nA stranding of Olive Ridley on 8/29/2012 was deleted as the location of this event was inaccurate.",

    "description": "Original provider:\nSmultea Environmental Sciences, LLC and HDR, Inc.\n\nDataset credits:\nSmultea Environmental Sciences\nU.S. Navy\nHDR, Inc.\n\nAbstract:\nMarine mammal aerial surveys were conducted from 30 August through 4 September 2013 in the Pacific Northwest inland Puget Sound waters. This effort was in support of Marine Mammal Protection Act permit monitoring requirements for the U.S. Navy to conduct marine mammal studies in waters on or adjacent to U.S. Naval installations in the inland Puget Sound Region, as well as offshore in the existing Northwest Training Range Complex (NWTRC) and Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC) Keyport Dabob Bay Range Complex (together known as the Northwest Training and Testing Study Area). Data are from one survey conducted under contract by Smultea Environmental Sciences (SES) and issued by HDR, Inc. There were 779 marine mammal sightings of over 1,716 animals representing 5,785 km (3,124 nm) of flight (both on and off effort).\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2017-07-05] The data format was updated to be consistent with other Navy datasets.",

Records also indicate leatherback, green, olive ridley, hawksbill, and loggerhead also utilized Ghana’s shore as nesting habitat.  There has not been a confirmed loggerhead or hawksbill nest in Ghana for 25 years indicating these two species have most likely been extirpated from the region.  Currently, the leatherback, olive ridley, and green sea turtles are the only remaining species nesting in Ghana. Sea turtles in this region are exposed to a maze of fishing vessels and nets that must be carefully avoided to reach the nesting beach.  Each year large sea turtle stranding events are documented during time periods of off-shore and near-shore fishing.  Illegal commercial fishing activity occurs regularly in shallow off-shore waters, whereas commercial and subsidence fishing take place near-shore and off the beach.  Understanding the temporal and spatial movement patterns of olive ridleys would provide information on the interaction of sea turtles and fisheries in Ghana's waters.With funding from the Disney Worldwide Conservation Fund, we are gathering knowledge and creating educational programs necessary to implementing a conservation program that is socially and economically self-sustaining over the long term.  The proposed research will answer key questions about the ecology of olive ridley sea turtles that will allow limited existing resources to be used most effectively into the future, and will incorporate educational programs to reverse the social perception of sea turtles so that their preservation is part of the cultural norm.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=468\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

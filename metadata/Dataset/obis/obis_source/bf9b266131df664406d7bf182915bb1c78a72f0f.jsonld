    "description": "A study of the scallop resources, advection and settlement of Pecten fumatus was carried out in Bass Strait and Great Oyster Bay, Tasmania, Australia on a series of cruises from 1986 to 1992. Scallop growth and reproduction were also analysed. Vessels used included Merindah Pearl and Dell Richey. Data sourced from https://marlin.csiro.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/845ec1c7-42cd-4b1f-8144-d9da1d7ca0d8. The dataset consists of 9 files covering shell size and weight, station logs, commercial catch data and environmental measurements within Bass Strait, with inadequate knowledge how to link the information together. This published set uses the Bridge_Logs.xls and is limited to true presence records.",

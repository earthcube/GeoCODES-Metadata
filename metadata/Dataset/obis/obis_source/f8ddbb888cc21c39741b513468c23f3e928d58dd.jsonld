    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nNOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC)\n\nAbstract:\nThis aerial survey was flown in conjunction with shipboard surveys being conducted during the same time frame. The R/V Abel-J was chartered to conduct line transect surveys offshore from 38 degrees N offshore from approximately 40 fathoms to the Gulf Stream, and north to the Northeast Channel east of Georges Bank, United States. The aerial survey covered all inshore areas from the beach to the 40 fathom boundary of the shipboard survey and extended east to Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Canada.\n\nPurpose:\nCollect line transect data to estimate abundance for as many species as possible.\n\nSupplemental information:\n3/8/2006: Data correction - humpback whale was mistakenly linked to Balaenidae (180531). It is now linked to <i>Megaptera novaeangliae</i> (180530). In addition to the sightings data, effort data were recorded every half hour or whenever conditions changed. This dataset, therefore, should be used with the effort data.",

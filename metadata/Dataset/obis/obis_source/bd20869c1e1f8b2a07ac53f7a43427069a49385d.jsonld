    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nNOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC)\n\nAbstract:\nThe survey was performed on the R/V Abel-J from 6 July to 4 August 1998 (Leg I), and from 8 August to 6 September 1998 (Leg II) starting and ending in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. The study areas in Leg I and Leg II, respectively, were from Cape Cod, Massachusetts to Virginia, and from Cape Cod, Massachusetts to Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. Both study areas extended from the 100 m depth contour to the Gulf Stream.\n\nPurpose:\nPrimary objectives of the survey were: \n1) Estimate the abundance of strategic species of pelagic dolphins and whales, such as common, spotted, and bottlenose dolphins, and sperm, pilot, and beaked whales, and \n2) Estimate the abundance of all other dolphins and whales detected in these waters.\n\nSecondary objectives included: \n1) Collect bongo, CTD, water depth and temperature data to correlate with the spatial distribution of the marine mammals,\n2) Conduct marine mammal photographic and video identification studies, and \n3) Collect biopsy samples.\n\nSupplemental information:\nIn addition to the sighting data, effort data were recorded  every half hour or whenever conditions changed. This dataset, therefore, should be used with the effort data.",

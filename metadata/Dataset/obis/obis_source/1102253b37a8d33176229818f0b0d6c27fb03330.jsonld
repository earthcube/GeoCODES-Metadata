    "description": "This dataset contains point distribution occurrences for fish species found in marine waters of Arctic Canada. It was used to create the distribution maps in the book Marine Fishes of Arctic Canada, edited by B.W. Coad and J.D. Reist (2018) and the DFO Data Report of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences Distributional Records for Marine Fishes of Arctic Canada (Alfonso et al. 2018). The database includes literature (Coad and Reist 2016) and museum records, anecdotal reports, personal communications and data from fisheries surveys and exploratory cruises. Development of the database began in 1998 and data entry ceased in 2016, although the database will be updated periodically. Consult the book (Coad and Reist 2018) and the Data Report (Alfonso et al. 2018) for further details in regards to the specific sources for each data point by species especially those from sources other than published literature.\n\nReferences:\nAlfonso, N.R., Coad, B.W., Sawatzky, C.D., and Reist, J.D. 2018.

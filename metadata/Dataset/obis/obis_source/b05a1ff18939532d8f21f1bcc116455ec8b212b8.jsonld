    "description": "Two turtles trapped in crab pot float lines were found by members of the public and admitted to Australia Zoo wildlife hospital. They underwent rehabilitation and had their front flippers amputated due to necrosis. Upon release they were fitted with Argos satellite transmitters to determine their movements and survival potential.\nData is from https://zoatrack.org/projects/4.",

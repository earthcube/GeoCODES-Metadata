    "description": "As part of a McGill University thesis project, grab samples were collected from two fiords on Ellesmere Island, NWT during two summer. Replicate samples were collected from various depths along a transect extending out from the shore with the objective of determining depth distributions of benthic polychaetes in the two fjords.\nVersion 1 of this dataset includes presence information for the dominant taxa. This information was extracted from thesis appendices (Curtis 1970). Nominal latitude and longitude coordinates have been assigned to this dataset as the exact locations where the grab samples were collected was not provided.",

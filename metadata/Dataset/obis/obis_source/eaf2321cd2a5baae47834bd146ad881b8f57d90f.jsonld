    "description": "This dataset contains cetacean observation data conducted during shipboard transects in the Chukchi Sea during the 9 August - 3 September 2015 Arctic Marine Biodiversity Observing Network (AMBON) research cruise. The dataset is two comma-separated values (csv) files describing the dates, times, latitude, longitude, species and best-high-low estimates of numbers for each cetacean (whales). This dataset was exported from the marine bird and mammal observation software WinCruz from the entire survey, and later transformed from the WinCruz format into Darwin Core formatted tables (DwC, occurrence core), with DwC term names as column names.",

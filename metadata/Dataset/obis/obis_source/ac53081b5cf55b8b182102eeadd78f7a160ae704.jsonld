    "description": "Species occurrence dataset from Drennan et al. (2021) Annelid Fauna of the Prince Gustav Channel, a previously ice-covered seaway on the northeastern Antarctic Peninsula. This study and dataset present a preliminary account of the benthic annelid fauna of the Prince Gustav Channel located on the northeastern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, and of Duse Bay, a sheltered, glacier-influenced embayment in the northwestern portion of the Prince Gustav Channel. Samples were collected as part of the British Antarctic Survey JR17003a expedition February-March 2018 on board the RSS James Clark Ross. The samples included in this dataset were collected using an Agassiz Trawl, targeting megafaunal and large macrofaunal sized animals at depths ranging between 200â€“1200m.",

    "description": "Original provider:\nCheng, I-Jiunn\n\nDataset credits:\nCheng, I-Jiunn\n\nAbstract:\nGreen turtle is an endangered species in Taiwan. In addition to understanding their nesting ecology, the migration behavior and whereabouts in the ocean are equally important. The purpose of the current study is to deploy as many satellite tags as possible to understand fully its post-nesting migration routes, rest/foraging areas and the influence of currents to the migration of green turtles. Furthermore, the combination of satellite tracking with genetic studies allow us to construct comprehensive conservation measures on a regional and international basis.\n\nPurpose:\nTo understand the whereabouts of green turtles that nest in Taiwan, and the influence of currents to the migration behavior.",

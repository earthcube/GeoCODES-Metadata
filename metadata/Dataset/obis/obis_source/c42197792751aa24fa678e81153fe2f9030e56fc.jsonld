    "description": "Sea snake collection records were compiled for use in two research projects: (a) Risk assessment and mitigation for sea snakes caught in the Northern Prawn Fishery (Fisheries Research and Development Corporation project 2005/051), and (b) Scientific support for regional marine planning and marine protected area design in the North Marine Region (A Department of the Environment and Water Resources (DEW) project). This metadata record refers specifically to the customised dataset that was created for delivery to DEW. The sea snake dataset is a compilation of collection records from CSIRO and other agencies. There are 11023 records of 41 species. The CSIRO data sources included the following: (a) Bycatch monitoring (FRDC 2002/035); (b) Bycatch sustainability (FRDC 96/257); (c) CSIRO red snapper project (ACIAR); (d) CSIRO scientific observer program, GOC, 1996-98; (e) CSIRO scientific observer program, GOC, 2000-01; (f) CSIRO scientific observer program, JBG, 2003; (g) Crew member observer program, GOC, 2003-05; (h) Effects of trawl design (FRDC 93/179); (i) GBR effects of trawling; (j) NPF pre-season monitoring; (k) Tropical fish (FIRDC 88/77); (l) Tropical prawn ecology 1992-1995; and (m) Tropical prawn project (Redfield). The non-CSIRO data sources were (a) Australian Museum, (b) Bureau of Rural Sciences, (c) NT Fisheries scientific observers, (d) Northern Territory Museum, (e) QDPI scientific observers, (f) Queensland Museum, and (g) Western Australian Museum.",

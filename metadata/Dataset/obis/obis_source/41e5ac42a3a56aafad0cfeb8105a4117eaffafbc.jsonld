    "description": "In early 2019 Parks Australia commissioned CSIRO to undertake a survey of selected marine and terrestrial environmental values at Ashmore Reef Marine Park. Specific foci for the marine component of the survey were to assess the abundance of key invertebrates which have historically been the subject of illegal fishing and over-exploitation (trochus, beche-de-mer and giant clams), and to assess status (cover and health) of key habitat forming benthic assemblages (corals, macroalgae and seagrass).\nThe terrestrial surveys were undertaken in May 2019 and the marine surveys in June 2019. Details are in the following metadata record https://marlin.csiro.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/269d73f5-1aa2-4e06-9805-1844dd9c7a6a\nAccess to this collection's metadata and/or data files (if any) are restricted until 31 Dec 2021. The current occurrence records have no abundance values. They will be published at the end of the embargo period.",

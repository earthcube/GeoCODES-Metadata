    "description": "Original provider:\nDaniel Palacios\n\nDataset credits:\nDaniel M. Palacios and Ocean Alliance\n\nAbstract:\nThis dataset contains sightings of marine mammals (whales, dolphins, otariids) collected off the Galápagos Islands, Ecuador, during three expeditions by the Ocean Alliance in 1988-1989, 1993-1994, and 2000, aboard research vessels Siben (1988-1989) and Odyssey (1993-1994, 2000).\n\nPurpose:\nThese sightings were collected during dedicated cruises primarily to study sperm whales.\n\nSupplemental information:\nSome records do not have time recorded. In this case, it is filled with “00:00:00” and noted in the [Notes] field.\n\nSome records do not have group size recorded. In this case, it is filled with “1” and noted in the [Notes] field.",

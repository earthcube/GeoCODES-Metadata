    "description": "Original provider:\nJonian Dolphin Conservation\n\nDataset credits:\nJonian Dolphin Conservation (JDC)\n\nAbstract:\nFounded in 2009, Jonian Dolphin Conservation (JDC) is a naturalistic association specializing in cetacean research, dolphin watching and educational programs. JDC has been studying the cetaceans of the Taranto coastal zone since April 2009. The research area is a wide band of sea between Ginosa Marina and Taranto. We work all year in the Ionian sea on a group of resident Striped Dolphin, and frequently we sight other species of cetaceans including Fin Whale, Risso's Dolphin and Bottlenose Dolphin.\n\nPurpose:\nThe Jonian Dolphin Conservation di Taranto has been studying the cetaceans of the Taranto coastal zone since April 2009. The research area is a wide band of sea 100 mi2, between Ginosa Marina and Taranto. We've spent almost 760 hours at sea and 140 hours with cetaceans. The surveys were conducted aboard a rubber dinghy 8.20 meters, equipped for ocean navigation. Normally, we use two different types of navigation: free surveys (carried out without following predefined routes) and surveys along linear transect.\n\nSupplemental information:\n11/29/2012: This dataset was updated with 2012 data.",

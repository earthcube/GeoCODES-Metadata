    "description": "Two silver (migratory) male freshwater eels, Anguilla dieffenbachii, were caught in a commercial trawl net in the South Taranaki Bight in April 2014. The capture date and the relatively small eye size indicated that both eels had probably only recently entered the sea. This is the first record of male A. dieffenbachii caught at sea, en route to the presumed spawning area in the South Fiji Basin",

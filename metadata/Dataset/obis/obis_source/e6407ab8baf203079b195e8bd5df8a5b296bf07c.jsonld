    "description": "From April 2007 to June 2009, six field trips were undertaken to investigate the elasmobranch faunal composition of the Ningaloo Marine Park (NMP), determine the distribution and abundance of species, and examine the habitat utilisation, movement patterns and activity space of selected key species. Dive and longline surveys, passive acoustic telemetry and satellite tracking were used to collect data.\nThis dataset is the tracking component of 5 Tiger sharks and one Great hammerhead.

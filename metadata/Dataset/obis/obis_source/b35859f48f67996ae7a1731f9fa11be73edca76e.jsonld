This survey was conducted by the NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center aboard the NOAA Ship <i>McArthur II<i> for a total of approximately 12,800 kilometers surveyed from late July to \nthe end of November 2008. This dataset provides the time-date and geographical coordinates, by species/stock, of all cetaceans detected during the survey, as well as the daily and intra-daily start and end points of the line-transect survey.\n\nPurpose:\nThe primary purpose of this survey was to estimate the abundance of and to describe the distribution of dolphins, whales, and porpoises off the west coast of the United States out to 300 nautical miles.\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2021-04-13] Updated with additional attributes.\n\nSWFSC MMTD Cruise Number: 1635\nPerpendicular distance will be released upon permission by the contributor. Please contact the contributor if needed.\n\nAttribute descriptions for effort data:\ndist: Length of the segment (km) \nMode: Effort mode type (C = closing mode; P = passing mode)</i></i>",

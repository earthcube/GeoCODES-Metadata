    "description": "The Bras d'Or “Lakes” are actually a complex estuary occupying the central part of Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia. Measuring 1,200 km2 in surface area and 13 km3 in volume, it consists of four basins, running in a northeast-southwest direction, separated by a series of low mountains, and connected by narrow channels, including two that open to the NE Atlantic ocean. \nAn article describing observations of Greenland cod (Gadus ogac) in the Bras d'Or Lakes was published in the Canadian Field-Naturalist (Scott 1952). Species distribution information associated with this article were digitized, standardized and republished by OBIS Canada as part of the Atlantic Coastal Zone Information Steering Committee (ACZISC) Atlantic Ecosystem Initiative (AEI) funded project “Atlantic Canada’s Biological Data for Ecosystem Planning and Decision-making” and OBIS Canada. \n\nThis resource contains counts of adult female cod captured during two line trawls in May of 1948 and June of 1949. These observations extended the southern distribution range of this species as known at the time that the article was published.",

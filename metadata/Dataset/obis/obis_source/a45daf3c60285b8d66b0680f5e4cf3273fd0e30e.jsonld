    "name": "Distribution of seabirds at sea in the Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia (1990-1991)",
    "description": "The distribution and abundance of seabirds was documented at sea in the Gulf of Carpentaria in December 1990 and November 1991. Of the 17 species recorded, only the crested tern, least frigatebird, brown booby and streaked shearwater were widespread. The first three species were seen mainly in coastal waters; streaked shearwaters were seen only in the central north-western gulf. The common tern, roseate tern, little tern, sooty tern, black-naped tern, common noddy and greater frigatebird were either sparsely distributed or uncommon. The list includes five terrestrial species. The distribution of\nthe seabirds is discussed in relation to proximity to breeding and roosting sites, food availability, the effects of discards from prawn trawling, and water currents\nData digitized from cited paper, January 2021. Some ambiguity of dates is possible as there are two voyages: 12 days in 1990 (3-14 December; Cruise 1) and 11 days in 1991 (19-29 November; Cruise 2).",

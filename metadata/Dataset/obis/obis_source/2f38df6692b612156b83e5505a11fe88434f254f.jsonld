    "description": "These data are amplicon sequence variant (ASV) counts of marine fish derived from environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling targeting the 12S rDNA, V5 region. DNA was extracted from filtered water samples taken off coastal New Jersey during the 2019 New Jersey Ocean Trawl Survey. Sampling corresponded to the New Jersey Ocean Trawl Survey efforts, but trawl data are not included here. The data were originally published as supplementary tables in support of Stoeckle et al. (https://doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsaa225). Observations from supplementary tables 8A - 8D were subsequently aligned to Darwin Core.",

    "description": "The dinoflagellate Tripos is globally widespread and as a recognised key indicator genus has the potential for being a marker for  climate-based changes in the ocean. As part of the Australian effort for the Second International Indian Ocean Expedition, 20 stations along the 110°E line from 39.5° to 11.5°S were sampled from the RV Investigator (voyage IN2019_V03) in 2019. Oceanic conditions ranged from cold, nutrient-rich Sub-Antarctic waters in the south to warm, oligotrophic tropical waters in the north. The Tripos assemblages along the transect were assessed relative to the changing environmental variables. We found four main Tripos groups at a 50% similarity/dissimilarity level where the assemblages were correlated with groups based on environmental conditions experienced during the voyage.\nVoyage details (metadata, projects, other datasets either online or as downloads, publications and reports, events, maps etc) can be accessed at https://www.marine.csiro.au/data/trawler/survey_details.cfm?survey=IN2019_V03\nIf this data has been used in any products, please acknowledge with the following: We acknowledge the use of the CSIRO Marine National Facility (https://ror.org/01mae9353) in undertaking this research.\n",

    "description": "Original provider:\nMarybio Foundation\n\nDataset credits:\nMarybio Foundation\n\nAbstract:\nIn recent decades, the population of southern right whales has been estimated to recover continuously, and that historical wintering grounds may be reoccupied gradually by this species as can be seen in the study area Bahía San Antonio, province of Río Negro, Argentina. Consequently, this apparent increase in right whale presence in Río Negro led to an increasing interest in the utilization of the species for local whale-based tourism.\n\nThis study was meant to present the first estimates of southern right whale abundance in Bahía San Antonio, being the most touristic coastal region of the province Río Negro, and to determine their group composition and behavioral reactions towards human interactions.\n\nPurpose:\nTo have an accurate estimate of abundance and group composition of southern right whales in Bahía San Antonio, Río Negro, Argentina.\n\nSupplemental information:\nSince time was not recorded, records were filled with 0:00:00 and noted in [Notes].",

    "description": "The AZMP was implemented in 1998 with the aim of collecting and analyzing the biological, chemical, and physical data to detect and monitor seasonal and interannual variability in eastern Canadian waters. The key element of the AZMP sampling strategy is the oceanographic sampling at fixed stations (every two weeks, conditions permitting) and along sections (1- 3 times per year). Field sampling and laboratory analyses are carried out following well-established common protocols.",

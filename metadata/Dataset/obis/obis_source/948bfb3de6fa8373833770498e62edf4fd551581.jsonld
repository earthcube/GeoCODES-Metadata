    "description": "Two intertidal fishing weirs located in Five Islands and Walton in the Minas Basin, Nova Scotia were used to collect and examine fish for the presence of ectoparasites. The focus was on the Atlantic sturgeon. Data collected during this study were part of a university honours project (Munroe, Samantha E.M. 2010).\nThis resource contains species distribution (presence) associated with this project.",

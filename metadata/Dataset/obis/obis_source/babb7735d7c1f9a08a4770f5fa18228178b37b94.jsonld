    "description": "Isopoda Latreille, 1816 is an order that consists of a vast number of taxa, living and thriving in land, sea, fresh- and groundwater. Isopods in the Southern Ocean are highly speciose and well-represented from the shelf to deep-sea zones. Southern Ocean isopod marine species and their biogeography, yet studied since the firsts Antarctic expeditions, are however poorly known. Regarding Ross Sea, isopod communities and assemblages are still less studied than the Weddell Sea ones. New biogeographical data regarding Ross Sea isopods are presented here, examining the National Antarctic Museum (MNA) Genoa section samples belonging to 15 Antarctic Expeditions.\nA total of 279 MNA samples were identified, resulting in 53 accepted species distributed in 24 families and 48 genera. From this identification, 15 species are considered new records for the Ross Sea area. GBIF and OBIS (Ocean Biodiversity Information System) (https://obis.org) databases, and bibliographic research were used as validation to the eventually new records for the Ross Sea area.\nThis dataset is published by Italian National Antarctic Museum (MNA) under the license CC BY 4.0.

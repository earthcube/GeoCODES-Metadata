    "description": "The Terra Nova Expedition, officially the British Antarctic Expedition, was led by Robert Falcon Scott with the primary objective of scientific experiments, observations and gathering of specimens and the secondary objective of being the first to reach the geographical South Pole. The Terra Nova Expedition, named after its supply ship, was a private venture, financed by public contributions augmented by a government grant. It had further backing from the Admiralty, which released experienced seamen to the expedition, and from the Royal Geographical Society. As well as its polar attempt, the expedition carried out a comprehensive scientific programme. The biologist in charge of operations on the ship was Mr. D. G. Lillie, M.A., to whose skill and energy the large and valuable marine collections are mainly due. On the outward and homeward voyages from England to New Zealand fine-meshed tow-nets were put overboard whenever possible, and seventy plankton samples were obtained; in addition two hauls were made with the trawl, one near the Falklands, at a depth of 125 fathoms, and one off Rio de Janeiro, at a depth of 40 fathoms. The winter cruise (July 10th to October 10th, 1911) round the Three Kings Islands and to the north of New Zealand produced biological results of great importance; eighty plankton samples were obtained, and the seven hauls made with trawl and dredge at depths of 15 to 300 fathoms revealed a bottom-fauna of extraordinary variety, including a great number of forms new to science. Between New Zealand and McMurdo Sound one hundred and thirty-five samples of plankton and fifty of muds and oozes were obtained; in the Ross Sea and in McMurdo Sound fifteen rich hauls with the trawl, at depths of 40 to 300 fathoms, produced a collection which has added greatly to our knowledge of the Antarctic marine fauna.",

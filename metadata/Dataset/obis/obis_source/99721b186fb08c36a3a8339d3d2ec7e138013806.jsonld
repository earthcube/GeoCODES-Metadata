    "description": "Original provider:\nCSIRO\n\nDataset credits:\nData provider\nBardi Jawi Turtle Tracking\nOriginating data center\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/\">Satellite Tracking and Analysis Tool (STAT)</a>\n\n\nAbstract:\nCSIRO and BHP Billiton have established a five-year research alliance to complement existing research and monitoring efforts at Ningaloo and to ensure the conservation and sustainable use of Ningaloo Reef. The research alliance comprises a comprehensive and integrated research program that includes three distinct research Themes (Deep Reefs, Shallow Reefs, Tagging Turtles and Sharks), as well as training of the next generation of scientists through a PhD Scholarship Scheme, and engagement with the local community.The Tagging theme will focus on turtles and reef sharks, which are key fauna inhabiting Ningaloo Reef. Our research on turtles in particular is intended to provide the basis for a broad program that integrates research with community participation. CSIRO is working with the local community and marine park managers (DPaW) to tag and track turtles using satellite and acoustic technology.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=1101\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

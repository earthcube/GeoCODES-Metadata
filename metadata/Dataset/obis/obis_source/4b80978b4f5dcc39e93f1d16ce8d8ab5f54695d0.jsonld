    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nSoutheast Fisheries Science Center, NOAA\n\nAbstract:\nA spring marine mammals survey  in Gulf of Mexico was conducted  in 1994 by NOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center to examine the diversity, distribution and estimate abundance of marine mammals in U.S. waters. The survey was aimed at meeting the responsibilities under the provisions of the Marine Mammal Protection Act. The survey was taken place along with Southeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program (SEAMAP). In addition, it was conducted in coordination with the Japanese vessel SHOYO MARU and a larval transport survey in the Florida Keys.\n\nThis dataset contains sightings of not only cetaceans but also other species including sea turtles, fish and shark observed during the ship survey.\n\nDuring the survey, at least 18 species were sighted, including\n\nAtlantic spotted dolphin\nClymene dolphin\nCuvierâ€™s beaked whale\nDwarf sperm whale\nDwarf/pygmy sperm whale\nFalse killer whale\nHumpback whale\nKiller whale\nMelon-headed whale\nNorthern right whale\nPantropical spotted dolphin\nPygmy sperm whale\nRisso's dolphin\nRough-toothed dolphin\nShort/Long-finned pilot whale\nSperm whale\nSpinner dolphin\nStandard Bottlenose dolphin\nStriped dolphin\n\nThe dataset  is accompanied by transect data which is provided as a separate file.\n\nPurpose:\nThe purpose of this survey is to examine the distribution and estimate abundance of cetaceans in U.S. waters.\n\nSpecific objectives of this survey are:\n\n1. Complete a line transect survey of the study area for marine mammals during daylight hours.\n\n2. Collect ichthyoplankton with bongo and double neuston trawl gear for estimates of abundance of eggs, larvae and small juveniles, particularly those of bluefin tuna.\n\n3. Obtain associated environmental and oceanographic data.\n\n4. Record data on marine life, seabirds and debris encountered during line transects.\n\n5. Obtain marine mammal biopsy samples for analysis.\n\n6. Collect tar samples encountered during  neuston sampling SEAMAP stations for analysis.\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2020-09-30] The following invalid species names were corrected according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS).\nBonaparte's Gull: Larus philadelphia (176839) =&gt; Chroicocephalus philadelphia (824040)\nBridled Tern: Sterna anaethetus (176897) =&gt; Onychoprion anaethetus (824104)\nGull-billed Tern: Sterna nilotica (176926) =&gt; Gelochelidon nilotica (176882)\nLaughing Gull: Larus atricilla (176837) =&gt; Leucophaeus atricilla (824079)\nLeast Tern: Sterna antillarum (176923) =&gt; Sternula antillarum (824127)\nRoyal Tern: Sterna maxima (176922) =&gt; Thalasseus maximus (824142)\nSandwich Tern: Sterna sandvicensis (176927) =&gt; Thalasseus sandvicensis (176932)\nSooty Tern: Sterna fuscata (176894) =&gt; Onychoprion fuscatus (824105)",

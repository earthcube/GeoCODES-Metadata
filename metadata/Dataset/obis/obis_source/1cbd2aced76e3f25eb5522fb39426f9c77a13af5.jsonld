    "description": "Original provider:\nHDR Environmental, Operations and Construction, Inc.\n\nDataset credits:\nThe U.S. Navy Marine Species Monitoring Program\n\nAbstract:\nThis dataset presents a Saipan subset of the results of the Guam and Saipan Marine Species Monitoring: Winter-Spring Survey conducted on the motor vessel (M/V) Sea Fantasy (Guam survey) and the M/V Super Emerald (Saipan survey) from 15 to 29 March 2012.\nThe objective of the 2012 survey effort was to conduct baseline surveys to further document marine mammal and sea turtle occurrence in nearshore waters around the island of Guam and Saipan. The approach primarily followed opportunistic survey protocols used in recent surveys around Guam (Ligon et al. 2011; HDR 2011), which remained within 10 kilometers (km) or 5.4 nautical miles (NM) of the coastline.\n\nPurpose:\nnot provided\n\nSupplemental information:\nA Guam subset of the survey is found at <a href=\"\"></a>",

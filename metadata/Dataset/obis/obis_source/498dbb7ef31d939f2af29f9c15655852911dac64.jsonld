    "description": "Focus of the herbivory study was on one type of habitat (seagrass meadows), and the diet of two species of herbivores (golden-lined rabbitfish and green turtle). Four surveys were conducted between October 2014 and April 2016. At these locations the following measurements or collections were made (not all measurements were made during each survey): (1) Rates of herbivory (three surveys). These data are presented in the report for WAMSI KMRP 2.2.4, here the focus is on assessing rates of herbivory as a proportion of primary production; (2) Collections of golden-lined rabbitfish (Siganus lineatus); and (3) Blood samples from green turtles (Chelonia mydas).\nData sourced from CSIRO Data Access Portal https://doi.org/10.4225/08/5a0be83e21ca2 on 2020-07-22.",

    "description": "Objective: To relate to oceanographic conditions the horizontal and vertical distribution of sea scallop larvae (Placopecten magellanicus) in the Canadian Gulf of Maine area (Bay of Fundy, western Scotian Shelf and Georges Bank)\n\nRecords in this dataset were digitized as part of an ongoing data recovery activity. Version 1 of the dataset contains counts of larvae per sample for cruises conducted in 1984. Abundance information (#/m3) is not included in this version. Records indicate the number of individual scallop larvae sized but these measurements are not included in this version.",

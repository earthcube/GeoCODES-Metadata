    "description": "The Atlas of Life in the Coastal Wilderness is an ongoing citizen-science project. It was originally the initiative of a small group of dedicated people who, in 2011, recognised the biological importance of the far south coastal region of NSW. They sought to encourage the documentation of the areaâ€™s biodiversity, building a community-based resource and network of contributors.\nData sourced from Atlas of Living Australia (https://collections.ala.org.au/public/show/dr702) December 2018. Taxa have been matched to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) and non-marine records have been excluded.",

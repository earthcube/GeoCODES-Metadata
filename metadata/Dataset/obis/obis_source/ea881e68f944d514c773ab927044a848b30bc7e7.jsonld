    "description": "Several surveys were undertaken to carry out a depth-stratified random trawl survey for orange roughy in southeast Australian waters between Kangaroo Island, South Australia (137 degrees E), and East Tasmania (148 degrees E). Target depths were from 700 to 1200m.\nThis data has been republished (2022-08-29 with additional details of each occurrence where they can be one of three types:  catch composition (counts per taxa and optional aggregated weights by trawl event), catch measurements (length and/or weight) of individual taxa and/or catch specimens and their stored location. The occurrence type is recorded in occurrenceremarks.",

    "description": "Protists are microscopic algae and protozoa, formerly thought of as single-celled plants and animals. Planktonic protists constitute the base of marine food webs and play a key role in the exchange of carbon dioxode between the atmosphere and the ocean. This list is of protists that live in the surface waters and sea-ice south of the Antarctic Polar Front.",

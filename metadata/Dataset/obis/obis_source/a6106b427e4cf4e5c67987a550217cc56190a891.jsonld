    "description": "This is the OBIS extraction of the OTN NTNU River Nidelva Project project, consisting only of the release tagging metadata. i.e. the locations  and dates of tagged animal release. If readers are  interested in the full source  dataset they should refer to the OTN web site  (members.oceantrack.org). Abstract: The purpose of the River Nidelva project is to monitor the migration of anadromous brown trout between river and fjord. Hatchery-reared sea trout are tracked in order to monitor their willingness to migrate to the ocean. Adult sea trout of wild origin are tagged and tracked for 14 months in order to map their movements between freshwater and saline habitats.",

    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nNational Marine Fisheries Service\n\nAbstract:\nThe cruise was conducted during 16 July 2 - August 2002. The area of operation was the western North Atlantic Ocean in the vicinity of Bear Seamount, located at approximately 39o 55' North latitude, 067o 25' West longitude, and along the continental slope south of Georgeâ€™s Bank.\n\nPurpose:\nThe cruise objectives were twofold: (1) to explore the biodiversity in the vicinity of Bear Seamount and to collect nekton (especially fish and cephalopod) specimens in bottom and midwater samples from the maximum depths possible and (2) to collect information on the distributional relationship between cetaceans, particularly beaked whales and sperm whales, oceanographic features, and potential prey.\n\nSupplemental information:\nIn addition to the sighting data, effort data was recorded  every half hour or whenever conditions change.\nThis dataset, therefore, should be used with the effort data.",

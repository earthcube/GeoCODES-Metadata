This combined with efforts to understand the global distribution of human interactions with sea turtles gives the ability to enact global sea turtle conservation. Strikingly missing from this suite of understanding is the olive ridley sea turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea), particularly Eastern Atlantic populations. Using satellite tags deployed from Gabon, Africa, we aim to determine olive ridley foraging strategies and oceanographic habitat, determine multi-species turtle hotspots, and their interactions with fisheries. This will result in a greater understanding of one of the least-studied species of sea turtle, where this species overlaps with other sea turtle species, and the ability to create effective fishery mitigation leading to comprehensive sea turtle conservation.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=146\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

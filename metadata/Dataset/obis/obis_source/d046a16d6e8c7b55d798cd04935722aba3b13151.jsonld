    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nNational Marine Fisheries Service\n\nAbstract:\nThe ship survey was performed from 22 July 1991 to 30 August 1991 to estimate the abundance and spatial distribution of harbor porpoises.\nThe study area, covering approximately 13,300 nm , was from Port Clyde, ME to 2\nSt. John, New Brunswick over to the Nova Scotian coast, up to Liverpool, Nova Scotia.\n\nPurpose:\nPRIMARY OBJECTIVES\n1) Estimate the abundance of harbor porpoises in the Gulf of Maine - Bay of Fundy - Nova Scotia area.\n2) Investigate if there are any spatial distribution patterns of the harbor porpoises, and if those patterns are correlated with water depth or harbor porpoise group\nsize.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES\n1) Estimate the abundance and spatial distribution of other cetaceans.\n2) Determine if harbor porpoise avoid this ship, and if so, at what distance.\n3) Determine if there is a spatial distribution pattern of mother-calf pairs of harbor porpoise.\n4) Compare the abundance estimate and spatial distribution of harbor porpoise as seen this year with that seen in previous years.\n5) Investigate if inland bays can be surveyed using a rigidhull inflatable boat as the observation platform in a line transect survey.\n6) Determine if Buckland's sighting procedure (1991), which is a line transect survey using both a primary and marking team, is a feasible procedure to estimate the abundance of harbor porpoise in the Bay of Fundy area.\n\nSupplemental information:\nIn addition to the sighting data, effort data was recorded  every half hour or whenever conditions change.\nThis dataset, therefore, should be used with the effort data.",

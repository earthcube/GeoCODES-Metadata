    "description": "Between 1993 and 1996 observations of individual leopard seals (Hydrurga leptonyx) Bird Island, South Georgia were recorded. The purpose of this study was to monitor haul out patterns, seasonality and diet of leopard seals. This sampling program resulted in a collection of photos of individual leopard seals, many of which were tagged or known individuals (based on scars or pelage patterns). The collection includes different gender and life stages and individuals exhibiting different behaviour such as feeding (Antarctic fur seal or penguin kills) or swimming. Individual seals may have been photographed multiple times. A number of individuals were tagged using Dalton Jumbotags, Dalton Supplies Ltd., UK. Other seals could be identified by unique markings (scars or pelage patterns). This resource is based upon this photo collection and includes presence information only – no information is provided to calculate density. The next version of this resource will be enhanced and include the photos associated with these observations. In addition it will also be expanded to include photos collected between 1993 to present (2016).",

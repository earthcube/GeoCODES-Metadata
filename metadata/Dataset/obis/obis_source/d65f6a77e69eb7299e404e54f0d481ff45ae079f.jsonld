    "description": "This dataset contains zooplankton occurrence data collected in the Northeast Pacific Ocean with a Juday net. These data were collected as part of the International Year of the Salmon (IYS) High Seas Expeditions conducted in March and April 2020, to further improve the understanding of the underlying food web structure and factors impacting salmon early marine winter survival. A Juday net (0.1 m2 mouth area, 160 um mesh size) was deployed to a depth of 200m at 37 stations in 2020. Samples were processed in the lab. Taxa were determined to lowest taxonomic rank possible. Where possible, sex and lifestage are determined. For count, abundance and biomass measurements, please reach out to the point of contact(s) listed.",

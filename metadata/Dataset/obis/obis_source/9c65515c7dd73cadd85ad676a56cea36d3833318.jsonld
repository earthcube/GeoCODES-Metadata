    "name": "Benthic Foraminifera Assemblages Collected From Two Sediment Cores in Emerald Basin, 1975",
    "description": "Data on marine benthonic foraminifera were obtained from samples collected in Emerald Basin (Scotian Shelf) during April 1965. The objective of the study was to investigate faunal changes between sediment collected from within and outside pockmarks. Sediment samples were collected from two cores spaced 280m away from each other with core 9 taken inside a pockmark and core 8 just outside the pockmark and were at 251m and 240m depth respectively.\n\nThe original report (Vilks, 1976)included measurements of organic carbon, chlorophyll, pheophytin, and sulphur.  The OBIS view of this dataset includes only the foraminifera species presence information. \n\nThe reports foraminifera results are presented in relative percent of the sample. See original text (Vilks, 1976) for explanations of diversity and similarity indices.",

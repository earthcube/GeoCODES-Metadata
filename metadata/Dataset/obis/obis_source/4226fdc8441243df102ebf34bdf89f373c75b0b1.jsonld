    "description": "Original provider:\nARCHELON, the Sea Turtle Protection Society of Greece\n\nDataset credits:\nData provider\nARCHELON (2004-2007)\nOriginating data center\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/\">Satellite Tracking and Analysis Tool (STAT)</a>\nProject partner\nARCHELON, the Sea Turtle Protection Society of Greece has been conserving turtles in Greece since 1983. In 2004 it expanded its work to coordinate and initiate a project in Syria.\nProject sponsor or sponsor description\nThe transmitter was purchased thanks to an award from the British Chelonia Group and is supported by SEATURTLE.ORG and Ford - Middle East.The project has been supported by the Marine Conservation Society Turtle Conservation Fund.\n\n\nAbstract:\nIn 2004, an important new green turtle rookery was dicovered in Syria. Follow up work discovered sea turtles are being utilised as food in the country and are being negatively impacted by fisheries interaction.In 2006 we are continuing the vital work from the last years and tracking a green turtle to identify her internesting habitat and post breeding migration. This was originally planned for 2005 but not realised due to the low nesting levels that year.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=76\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

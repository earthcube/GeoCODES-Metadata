    "description": "Caspian Sea is the biggest land-locked saltwater lake in the world with a catchment area of 3.5 million km2. It is located between 36° N and 62°N. The basin of Caspian Sea is divided into three distinct physical regions: Northern, Middle, and Southern Caspian. Phytoplanktons are the autotrophic components of the plankton community and a key part of marine and freshwater ecosystems. They obtain energy through photosynthesis, as do plants on land. This means phytoplankton must receive light from the sun, so they live in the surface layers of oceans and lakes. The collected data of the phytoplanktons of the Caspian Sea are related to a part of the studies conducted from 1996 to 2021. These data are obtained from various sources such as (articles, theses, research projects, etc.).",

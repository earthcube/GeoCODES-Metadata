    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nMarine Mammal and Turtle Division, Southwest Fisheries Science Center, NMFS, NOAA\n\nAbstract:\nThe 2008 Vaquita Expedition was a joint US-Mexican effort to provide the best scientific data possible to aid the government of Mexico in conservation decisions for the vaquita. The study area was the northern end of the Gulf of California south to about 30.8 degrees north latitude. A line-transect survey of the deeper water of the study area was conducted by the NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center aboard the NOAA ship <i>David Starr Jordan</i> in October and November 2008. This dataset provides the time-date and geographical coordinates, by species/stock, of all cetaceans detected during the survey, as well as the daily and intra-daily start and end points of the line-transect survey.\n\nPurpose:\nThe primary objective was to collect data to estimate the abundance vaquita, or Gulf of California harbor porpoise.\n\nSupplemental information:\nThis dataset is supplemental to the following datasets:\nSWFSC Marine Mammal Survey, Vaquita 1997, Cruise 1608",

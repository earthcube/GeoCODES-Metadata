    "description": "Phytoplankton data collected in the Black Sea, Bosphorus  area, Marmara Sea, Aegean Sea, Ionian Sea, Tunisian Strain, and Mediterranean Sea during 65 cruise of the R/V \"Kovalevskiy\" and processed by Lyudmila Georgieva. \nThe samples were taken with 6 liter bathometers at standard depths and in the thermocline layer.  The standard sedimentation technique for samples preparation (Usachev, 1926) was used. Samples were preserved by buffered formalin 40% and were settled within 30 days. Then a volume of water was siphoned off and samples were concentrated to 10-20 ml. After thorough mixing the subsamples (0.05 or 0.1 ml) were transferred to the counting chamber. Organisms were counted in two subsamples at Ã—300 - 400 magnification.",

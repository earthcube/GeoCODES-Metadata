    "description": "A research program has been initiated by the Minerals Management Service to gain better knowledge of the benthic communities of the deep Gulf of Mexico entitled \"The Deepwater Program: Northern Gulf of Mexico Continental Slope Habitat and Benthic Ecology\". Increasing exploration and exploitation of fossil hydrocarbon resources in the deep-sea prompted the Minerals Management Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior to support an investigation of the structure and function of the assemblages of organisms that live in association with the sea floor in the deep-sea. The program, \"Deep Gulf of Mexico Benthos\" or DGoMB, is studying the northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM) continental slope from water depths of 300 meters on the upper continental slope out to greater than 3,000 meters water depth seaward of the base of the Sigsbee and Florida Escarpments. This dataset contains the invertebrate data.",

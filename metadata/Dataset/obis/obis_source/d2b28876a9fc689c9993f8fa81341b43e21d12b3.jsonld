    "description": "This dataset contains classified benthic data from 2,668 still images collected using a towed underwater camera system around the Lord Howe Island and Balls Pyramid shelves. Underwater imagery were collected at 39 sites in depths ranging 6 m to 115 m from surveys aboard the RV Southern Surveyor in February 2013 and Lord Howe Island Marine Park vessel Tursiops in November 2013.\nThe data published here is the taxa classified to genus level or better. The original data has been classified using the Collaborative and Annotation Tools for Analysis of Marine Imagery and Video (CATAMI) classification scheme as a standard for scoring marine biota and physical characteristics from underwater imagery.",

    "description": "The following resource is based on content included in a special publication providing an overview of the visiting and nesting birds that have traveled through Nova Scotia’s Bay of Fundy region and made a stopover on Brier Island. This resource contains a list of what is or has been present on and around the island. NOTE: Not all taxa recorded in this list are regular visitors or inhabitants of the island - any migratory species might be found moribund on the coast or taking refuge on a ship’s rigging in the middle of the Bay of Fundy.\n\nThis version of the resource contains species presence information only and the observation location information has been generalized to a nominal set of coordinates for the island. Please consult the original publication (Mills and Laviolette, 2011) for detailed information on each species.\n\nThe 356 species described in the manuscript were classified based on the American Ornithologists' Union checklist (http://checklist.aou.org/). This resource has retained this classification but each taxon has also been associated with scientific name IDs (life science identifiers/LSIDs) based upon entries in the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) or the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS).\n\nThis version of the resource contains observations from 1880 to January 1, 2016.",

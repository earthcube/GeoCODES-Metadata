    "description": "A study of zooplankton from 10 stations located in nearshore waters adjacent to two catchments (one near-pristine - Princess Charlotte Bay, and the other intensely farmed - Innisfail) of the Great Barrier Reef.\n\nCTD casts were made through the water column at each station for salinity and temperature data. Water samples for chlorophyll a were made. Environmental variables include day and night, location and date (can allocate season, year).\n\nMesozooplankton community structure and biomass were sampled by triplicate bottom to surface plankton hauls. Half of each sample was analysed for community composition (65 zooplankton taxa found) and the other for DW biomass estimates based on size (73-150µm, 150-350µm, &gt;350µm).\nTaxa have been matched to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS). This dataset was sourced on July 2018 from the original DiGIR dataset at OBIS and updated to reflect changes in the OBIS data requirements.",

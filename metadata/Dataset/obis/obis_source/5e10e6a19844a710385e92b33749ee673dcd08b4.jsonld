    "description": "The MAGNT reptile collection, established in 1981, consists of about 37,000 databased specimens, the majority of which have been collected in the Northern Territory. The collection includes 71 holotypes and 915 paratypes. Historical subcollections include the Arid Zone Collection from Central Australia.\n\nThe majority of the specimens have been fixed in 10% formalin prior to being transferred into 70% ethanol for long term storage. Recently, frozen and ethanol-fixed tissue samples have been kept for genetic studies.\n\nSpecimens can be lent to workers at other institutions upon application and the MAGNT also welcomes visiting researchers.\n\nThe collection was established in 1981 and continues to the present.",

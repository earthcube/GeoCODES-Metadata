    "description": "Original provider:\nDensity Estimation of Cetaceans from passive Acoustic Fixed sensors (DECAF)\n\nAbstract:\nThis archive contains data on sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) recorded at the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC) in the Tongue of the Ocean, Bahamas in August-September 2007. Data are provided showing when sperm whales were detected on the range during the time period, details about the availability of the acoustic data used in the analysis and finally, the number and size of sperm whale groups localized.\nRecords in this dataset represent a sample of data used in the sperm whale group localizations. Fifty 10-minute periods were randomly subsampled from the available acoustic files, and clicking animals were localized, where possible. By chance, some 10-minute periods did not contain any sperm whale clicks.\n\nPurpose:\nThis dataset used multiple hydrophones at AUTEC to detect sperm whale clicks. Click trains from individual whales were identified, enabling the number of diving whales to be estimated. Assuming that all diving sperm whale groups at a given time are detected by AUTEC, then density of diving sperm whales can be estimated.\n\nSupplemental information:\nRecords in this dataset represent the sample of data used in the sperm whale group localizations. Each record represents the detection of a whale on a given hydrophone. A single whale may be heard on multiple hydrophones, as indicated in series.\nThe related dataset describing when sperm whales were detected on the range is available at http://seamap.env.duke.edu/dataset/682.\n\nOriginal data can be downloaded at http://www.creem.st-and.ac.uk/decaf/decaf-data-files under Case Study 2: Sperm whale data\n\nTime zone is GMT.\nHydrophone locations are approximate.",

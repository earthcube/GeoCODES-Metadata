    "description": "This is the OBIS extraction of the Ocean Tracking Network  and Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Bedford Institute of Oceanography (DFO-BIO)  Bay of Fundy: Spiny Dogfish, consisting of the release tagging metadata, i.e. the location and date when the tagged animal was released, and summarized detection events of tagged individuals.\n    If readers are interested in the source dataset they may also inquire with the project PIs as listed here or on the OTN web site (https://members.oceantrack.org/project?ccode=WDG).\nAbstract:To determine if mature female dogfish remain in Canadian waters or if they cross over the US/Canadian border to American waters. The results would have an effect on the joint management of the dogfish fishery between Canada and the US and help determine the contribution spawning females have to the NW Atlantic metapopulation of dogfish. The data would help with future management of the fishery as well as future discussions with the US.",

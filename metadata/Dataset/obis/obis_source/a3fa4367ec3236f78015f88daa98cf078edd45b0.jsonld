    "description": "Original provider:\nDG Nicholls &amp; Peter Ryan\n\nDataset credits:\nData provider\nMarion Island Wanderers &amp; Winds\nOriginating data center\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/\">Satellite Tracking and Analysis Tool (STAT)</a>\n\n\nAbstract:\nWandering albatross fly enormous distances but only with the assistance of the wind. Typically they reach or run with the wind on the longest fastest flights. However, they can also fly at almost all angles to the wind. Presumably the bird must make a greater effort and or the flight ground speed is slower.In the 1990s, MD Murray and DG Nicholls explored many of these relationships. New satellite with sensors directly measuring wind speed and direction will allow increased precision in studies of the relationship between bird flight and the wind.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=209\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

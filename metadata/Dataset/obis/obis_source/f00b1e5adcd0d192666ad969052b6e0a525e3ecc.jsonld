    "description": "The principal study area was located along the Habitant Creek estuary southeast of Canning, Kings County, NS in a Spartina patens and S. alterniflora marsh next to the old pilings of Pickett's Wharf.\nHabitant Creek is dyked to the west of the saltmarsh area and fresh water flows out through an aboideau only at low tide, some 6m below the level of the marsh. The marsh extends in width about 250 m from the adjacent roadbed to the creek bank at the wharf pilings. This resource contains a listing of taxa observed in this area.",

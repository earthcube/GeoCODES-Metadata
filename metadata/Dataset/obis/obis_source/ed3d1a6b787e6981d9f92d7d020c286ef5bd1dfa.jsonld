    "description": "The list of corals for the Virgin Islands National Park/Biosphere Reserve has been compiled and added to during four decades of research and monitoring of coral reef resources in the waters around St. John. The majority of this list comes from Beets and Lewand (1986) with additions and updates by several other experts over the years. Specimens of most of these species reside in the natural history collection at the V.I. National Park.",

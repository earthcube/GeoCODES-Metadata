    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nMarine Mammal and Turtle Division, Southwest Fisheries Science Center, NMFS, NOAA\n\nAbstract:\nThe Cetacean Acoustic Detection and Dive Interval Studies (CADDIS) survey was conducted by the NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center primarily in the southern Gulf of California aboard NOAA research ship <i>McArthur</i> from early September to early November 1995 for a total of approximately 6,000 kilometers surveyed. The project focused on two potential approaches to improve abundance estimates of long-diving whales: (1) acoustic detection of diving animals, and (2) collecting dive interval data on those species to serve as a basis for a model-based abundance correction factor. This dataset provides the time-date and geographical coordinates, by species/stock, of all cetaceans detected during the survey, as well as the daily and intra-daily start and end points of the line-transect survey.\n\nPurpose:\nThe primary purpose of this research was to learn how to better estimate the abundance of long-diving whales during ship line-transect surveys. These whale species, including beaked whales and dwarf and pygmy sperm whales, dive for such long periods of time that there is a high probability that they will never surface within the visual range of observers searching from a moving survey vessel with 25X binoculars.",

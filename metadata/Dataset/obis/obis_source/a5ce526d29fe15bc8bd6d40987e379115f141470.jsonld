    "name": "Sightings of southern right whales around mainland New Zealand 1976-2002",
    "description": "The  status  of  southern  right  whales  around  ‘mainland’  New  Zealand  was assessed  by  reviewing  110  sightings  and  23  individual  photo-identifications collected  between  1976  and  2002.  Sightings  were  reported  in  11  of  the  12 Conservancies (Department of Conservation administrative areas) with coastal waters.  Southland  Conservancy  was  the  primary  area  visited  by  non-cow/calf whales and Hawke's Bay Conservancy represented the primary area for cow/calf pairs. Whales were sighted in all seasons with the majority of sightings reported in winter (60%) and spring (22%). Between 1988 and 2001 (when whales were consistently  sighted),  southern  right  whales  showed  a  significant  increase  in number of sightings and number of whales per sighting. The estimated rate of increase  is  imprecise  and  likely  affected  by  uneven  sighting  effort  over  the years.  Despite  this  apparent  increase  in  overall  sightings,  there  was  little evidence  of  increase  in  the  number  of  cow/calf  pairs  sighted  around  New Zealand’s three main islands (‘the mainland’). No matches were made between 26  photo-identified  whales  from  around  the  mainland  and  the  extensive  catalogue  of  whales  photo-identified  in  the  subantarctic  islands.  The  former population  remains  severely  depleted,  and  likely  contains  between  4  and  11reproductive females. The lack of evidence of movement between the mainland and the subantarctic islands and the marked difference in recovery between the two areas suggests that the two populations represent separate stock.",

    "description": "During the spring and summer of 1917 a marine biological investigation was carried on in the Gulf of St. Lawrence under the direction of Dr. A. G. Huntsman. Samples were collected at various points near the north and west shores of Cape Breton, from the vincity of the Magdalen islands and at some points in a line between Eastern Harbour, Cape Breton and the Magdalen islands. Hydrology and biology of the western Gulf of St. Lawrence was studied.\n\nThis resource contains the amphipod collection associated with this expedition. At that time, this collection formed the largest and most comprehensive collection of amphipods from the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Amphipods were collected from the shore to 90 metres.\n\nThis resource contains presence information only - no abundance information is available",

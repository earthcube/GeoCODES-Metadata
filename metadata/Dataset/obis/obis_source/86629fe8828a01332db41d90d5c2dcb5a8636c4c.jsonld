    "description": "The dataset comprises catch records of invertebrates and fish from epibenthic sled deployments completed on research voyage SS 03/2005. The survey design was a natural experiment (i.e. control-impact, but not before-after) to test the long-term, broadscale effects of prawn fishing on non-target species and habitats. Deployments were stratified by fishing intensity (three strata) and day/night. The survey was repeated in three regions: (a) north of Groote Eylandt, (b) north-east of the Vanderlins, and (c) north of Mornington Island. The number of deployments completed as part of the natural experiment was 124. Two additional deployments were completed for other reasons.\nSurvey details (voyage track, deployments, reports, other datasets) are at https://www.marine.csiro.au/data/trawler/survey_details.cfm?survey=SS200503",

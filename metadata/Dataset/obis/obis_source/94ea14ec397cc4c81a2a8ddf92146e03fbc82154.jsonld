    "description": "Geoscience Australia carried out marine surveys in Jervis Bay (NSW) in 2007, 2008 and 2009 (GA303, GA305, GA309, GA312) to map seabed bathymetry and characterise benthic environments through co-located sampling of surface sediments (for textural and biogeochemical analysis) and infauna, observation of benthic habitats using underwater towed video and stills photography, and measurement of ocean tides and wave-generated currents. Data and samples were acquired using the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO) Research Vessel Kimbla. Bathymetric mapping, sampling and tide/wave measurement were concentrated in a 3x5 km survey grid (named Darling Road Grid, DRG) within the southern part of the Jervis Bay, incorporating the bay entrance. Additional sampling and stills photography plus bathymetric mapping along transits was undertaken at representative habitat types outside the DRG. Sample/species matrix of infaunal taxa derived from Van Veen grab samples taken on the HMS Kimbla surveys GA0312 and GA0315 in Jervis Bay.\nMetadata at https://ecat.ga.gov.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/72011 Survey report Kimbla0109_Record_2009_12_Jervis Bay.pdf at http://dapds00.nci.org.au/thredds/catalog/fk1/Post-survey_reports/catalog.html",

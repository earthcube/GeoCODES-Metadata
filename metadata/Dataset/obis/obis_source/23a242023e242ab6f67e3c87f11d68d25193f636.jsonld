    "description": "The Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory (MAGNT) Porifera (sponge) collection includes more than 7500 registered specimens. The collection includes 51 holotypes and 51 paratype lots. Microscope slides (spicule and thick section preparations) are associated with most of the registered material.\nThe collection comprehensively covers Northern Australia, but also includes specimens from other regions in Southeast Asia (e.g. The Philippines and Thailand) and the Western Central Pacific. Many species in the collection represent new species and are undescribed.",

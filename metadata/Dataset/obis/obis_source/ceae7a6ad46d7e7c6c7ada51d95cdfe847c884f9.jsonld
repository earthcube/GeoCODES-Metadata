    "description": "This is the OBIS extraction of the OTN NS Blue Shark Tracking project, consisting only of the release tagging metadata. i.e. the locations  and dates of tagged animal release. If readers are  interested in the full source  dataset they should refer to the OTN web site  (members.oceantrack.org). Abstract: In the Northwest Atlantic, the Ocean Tracking Network (OTN), in collaboration with Dalhousie University, is using an acoustic telemetry infrastructure to monitor the habitat use, movements, and survival of juvenile blue sharks (Prionace glauca). This infrastructure includes state-of-the-art acoustic receivers and oceanographic monitoring equipment, and autonomous marine vehicles carrying oceanographic sensors and mobile acoustic receivers.  Long-life acoustic tags (n=40) implanted in the experimental animals will provide long-term spatial resolution of shark movements and distribution, trans-boundary migrations, site fidelity, and the speciesâ€™ response to a changing ocean. This study will facilitate interspecific comparisons, documentation of intra- and interspecific interactions, and permit long-term monitoring of this understudied predator in the Northwest Atlantic. The study will also provide basic and necessary information to better inform fisheries managers and policy makers. This is pertinent given the recent formulation of the Canadian Plan of Action for Shark Conservation.",

    "name": "CSIRO, Catch records from eddy studies off the New South Wales coast, Australia 1979-1980",
    "description": "The data were obtained as part of a time series study of Eddy \"J\" in the Tasman Sea off the New South Wales Coast. Stations inside and outside the eddy were sampled for hydrology/nutrients, phytoplankton fluorescence and particle size, zooplankton (including organic nitrogen), and midwater fishes using the RMT (rectangular midwater trawl) net. Within the eddy, the most abundant family of fishes in the midwater trawls was family Myctophidae (lanternfishes). Decapod crustacea, salps and squid were also enumerated. Some squid jigging with hand lines was also carried out on two occasions.\nThis data has been republished (2022-09-05 with additional details of each occurrence where they can be one of three types:  catch composition (counts per taxa and optional aggregated weights by trawl event), catch measurements (length and/or weight) of individual taxa and/or catch specimens and their stored location. The occurrence type is recorded in occurrenceremarks.\n\n",

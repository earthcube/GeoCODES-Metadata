    "description": "We present a comprehensive and update checklist systematic of the icthyofauna of this insular region, which is comprised by 366 species, 241 genera, 101 families, 28 orders and tree classes. The families with the most richness specific were: Carangidae (20 spp.), Serranidae (19) and Muraenidae (18). Socorro Island was recorded 220 species, Clarion Island 179, San Benedicto Island 128; followed by Roca Partida Island 62. This diversity as well as endemic species number is relationship with the surface of each island. There is a higher similarity ictiofaunistic between Clarion Island and Socorro Island; while, the lowest similarity was between San Benedicto Island and Roca Partida Island. The ichthyogeography of the Revillagigedo Archipelago has a higher affinity with the Panamic province (42.3%), followed by the Cortes (41.5%). A higher number of species are of the wide distribution (circumglobal: 21 %; amphipacific 22.4 %). Also, endemic species are represented by 26 species (7.1%).",

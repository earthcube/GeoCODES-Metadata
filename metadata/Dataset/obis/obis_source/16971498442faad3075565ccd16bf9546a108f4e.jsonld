    "description": "Original provider:\nMabel Nava\n\nAbstract:\nOf the four species of marine turtles commonly observed breeding in the Caribbean, three species, the loggerhead (Caretta caretta), the green turtle (Chelonia mydas) and the hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) regularly nest on the beaches of Bonaire and Klein Bonaire, Dutch Caribbean.\nWhereas juvenile green and hawksbill turtles can be observed year-round in the neritic waters surrounding Bonaire and Klein Bonaire, adult marine turtles are only rarely seen outside of the breeding season, which combined for the three species lasts from May to December. In-water surveys of marine turtles conducted in all potential foraging habitats around the islands indicate that adult marine turtles are seasonal visitors and do not reside permanently in the islandsâ€™ waters. \nWe used satellite telemetry starting in 2003 to address the question of where the foraging grounds are located of the turtles breeding at Bonaire and Klein Bonaire. Our principal objectives were to identify the migratory pathways and the foraging ground locations of post-reproductive marine turtles, in order to deepen our understanding of the potential threats facing these animals.\n\nSupplemental information:\n2012-10-12: A sea turtle identified as 'Valley' was not properly registered and was not shown on the map. The issue is fixed.\n2012-10-12: Turtles identified 'Funny' and 'STINAPA' got wrong tag ids. The issue is fixed.",

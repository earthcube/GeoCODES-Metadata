    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nNOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center\n\nAbstract:\nThe Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center conducted cetacean surveys aboard the NOAA Oscar Elton Sette during the ship's transit from Guam to Hawaii (19 April - 4 May 2010) and covered 2,719 km of on-effort trackline.  There were 23 cetacean sightings, 15 of which were identified to five species. Time and weather limitations prevented the shipâ€™s approach of more of the sighted cetacean groups.\n\nSupplemental information:\nData were collected under NMFS permit 14097.\nThe data included here are the sightings and on-effort tracks recorded within WinCruz survey software and extracted from the QA/QC'd DAS file using the R package swfscDAS (https://smwoodman.github.io/swfscDAS).\n\nAttributes for fields within the trackline files:\nCruise - see description in attribute table below\nsegnum - segment number for continuous on-effort line\nDate - Local date m/dd/yyyy\nTimeStart - Local time at start of on-effort segment\nLatStart - Latitude in decimal degrees at starting point of on-effort segment\nLongStart - Longitude in decimal degrees at starting point of on-effort segment\nTimeEnd - Local time at end of on-effort segment\nLatEnd - Latitude in decimal degrees at end point of on-effort segment\nLongEnd - Longitude in decimal degrees at end point of on-effort segment\nMode - see description in attribute table below\nEffType - see description in attribute table below\navgSpdKt - average speed (knots) of the ship over the on-effort segment traveled\navgBft - average Beaufort Sea State over the on-effort segment\n\nOther data not included here:\nPhotos and biopsy samples were collected during some sightings. Acoustic detections were recorded from a towed hydrophone array. Sonobuoys were deployed opportunistically. A High-frequency Acoustic Recording Package (HARP) was recovered and redeployed off Wake Island. Oceanographic data were collected (CTD, XBT, continuous plankton recorder).",

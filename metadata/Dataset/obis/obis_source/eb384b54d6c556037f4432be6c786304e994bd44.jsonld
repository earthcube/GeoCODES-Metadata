    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nNOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC)\n\nAbstract:\nThe ship survey was performed from 29 July 1992 to 06 September 1992,\nstarting and ending in Woods Hole, MA. The study area, covering approximately 13,300 nmi2, was from Portland, ME to St. John, New Brunswick over to Port Joli, Nova Scotia on the southeast side of Nova Scotia.\n\nPurpose:\nPRIMARY OBJECTIVE\nEstimate the abundance of harbor porpoises in the Gulf of Maine - Bay of Fundy - Scotian shelf\narea.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES\n1) Determine the spatial distribution patterns of harbor porpoises, and investigate if the patterns are correlated with hydrographic or biological features, such as, the depth, temperature or salinity of the water or with targets seen on an acoustic fish finder.\n2) Estimate the abundance and spatial distribution of other cetaceans.\n3) Determine if harbor porpoise avoid this ship, and if so, at what distance.\n4) Use a 17 foot Zodiac rigid-hulled inflatable boat (RIB) and the R/V Abel-J to survey the Penobscot Bay - Blue Hill Bay area and other bays and harbors along the Maine and Nova Scotia coast.\n5) Determine if there is a spatial distribution pattern of mother-calf pairs of harbor porpoise.\n6) Compare the abundance estimate and spatial distribution of harbor porpoise as seen this year with that seen in previous years.\n7) Determine dive time patterns of individual and groups of harbor porpoises around the sighting platform.\n8) Investigate the utility of 2 new electronic data entry systems.\n9) Determine the distribution of marine mammals between the northeastern edge of the study area and Halifax, Nova Scotia, on Brown' s Bank, and on the continental shelfbreak in the area south of Brown' s Bank.\n\nSupplemental information:\nIn addition to the sighting data, effort data was recorded  every half hour or whenever conditions change.\nThis dataset, therefore, should be used with the effort data.",

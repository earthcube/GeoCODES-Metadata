    "description": "Original provider:\nHubbs-Sea World Research Institute\n\nAbstract:\nSystematic surveys, conducted between 28 October 1978 and 13 November 1979 in the waters adjacent to Puerto la Cruz and Isla Margarita, Venezuela, documented the presence, distribution and habits of a population of Bryde's whales. Methods included aerial and boat surveys, interviews with local fishermen, and radio-tagging. Bryde's whales, apparently attracted by the abundance of food, were observed in the area between March and December; numbers were greatest in fall. Distribution within the study area varied with season: between march and August the whales were seen in the eastern part; from August to December in the western. Herd size increased from march through October. Although several cow and calf pairs were seen, breeding activities were not, and there is no evidence that this is a breeding area.\n\nPurpose:\nSurveys were supported by the local company Turismo Margarita S.A., to better understand the causes of collisions between passenger jet hydrofoils and large marine animals, and advise on procedures to minimize such risk.\n\nSupplemental information:\nAn accompanying aerial survey dataset  <a href=\"http://seamap.env.duke.edu/dataset/836\">Bryde's whales off eastern Venezuela - Aerial 1978-1979</a> is available.\n\nThe provider digitized the locations from the literature.\n\nThe accuracy of the dates is year. Months and days are approximate.\n\nNo time is provided. Substituted with 00:00:00.\n\nNo group size is provided. Substituted with 1.",

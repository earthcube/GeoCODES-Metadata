    "description": "This database is a global compilation based on the distribution of 2201 species from the class Ophiuroidea, with historical records from the last 130 years.. The data consist mostly of voucher specimens stored in museums and examined by experts;  There are in total 95 559 records, of which 44% are from below 200 m depth extending to 8135 m depth. Of the deep-sea records, 15% were collected between 1976 and 2018 on cruises organised by the Tropical Deep Sea Benthos program, which also facilitated an international network of taxonomists to work on the specimens.. See cited paper and related bibliography for more details\nSome of the records are from the CSIRO Marine National Facility and is used in any products, please acknowledge with the following: We acknowledge the use of the CSIRO Marine National Facility (https://ror.org/01mae9353) in undertaking this research.\n",

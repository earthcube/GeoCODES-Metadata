    "description": "Original provider:\nHDR Environmental, Operations and Construction, Inc.\n\nDataset credits:\nThe U.S. Navy Marine Species Monitoring Program\n\nAbstract:\nAerial surveys to monitor marine mammals and sea turtles (MM/ST) were conducted in\nconjunction with two training events during the period February 16 to March 5, 2011, including:\n(a) U.S. Navy Submarine Commanderâ€™s Course (SCC) naval training event in the Hawaii Range\nComplex (HRC) on the Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF) instrumented range between Kauai\nand Niihau, Hawaii; and \n(b) Undersea Warfare Exercise (USWEX) training event south of Oahu\nand Molokai. Surveys in support of the SCC event occurred on 4 consecutive days from\nFebruary 16 to 19, 2011, in waters adjoining Kauai and Niihau where the missile destroyer (DDG) and other ships were operating, followed by shoreline surveys of Kauai and Niihau on 2 separate days thereafter: February 24 and 26, 2011. This was followed by shoreline surveys of the Four\nIslands region in support of the USWEX event on 2 separate days, February 28 and March 5, 2011. The survey methods and sampling design were submitted and approved in advance, per the statement of work (SOW), to the Navy Technical Representative (NTR) and followed previously established protocol (Mobley and Milette 2010; Smultea et al. 2009a,b).\n\nPurpose:\nnot provided\n\nSupplemental information:\nThis dataset includes sightings during the SCC shoreline surveys.\n\nSightings during the ship-follow surveys are available: <a href=\"http://seamap.env.duke.edu/dataset/922\">HRC SCC Aerial-based Shp-follow Surveys  February 2011</a>\n\nSightings during the transect surveys are available: <a href=\"http://seamap.env.duke.edu/dataset/923\">HRC SCC Aerial-based Transect Surveys  February 2011</a>\n\nData for the USWEX shoreline surveys are available:\n<a href=\"http://seamap.env.duke.edu/dataset/925\">HRC USWEX Aerial-based Shoreline Surveys  February and March 2011</a>",

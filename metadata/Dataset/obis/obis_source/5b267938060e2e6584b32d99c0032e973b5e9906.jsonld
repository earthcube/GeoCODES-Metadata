    "description": "The bird collection focuses on Queensland and Papua New Guinea regions, documenting an historical record of species distributions, past and present. Skin, skeleton and spirit collections dating back to the 1870s, including extinct species, provide a valuable reference resource for biological and ecological studies. These holdings are supplemented with more than 5,000 egg clutches and 300 nests.\nThis dataset is of marine species sourced from the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) January 2019 (https://collections.ala.org.au/public/show/co151). Taxa have been matched to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) and if not then matched to the Australian Faunal Directory (AFD)",

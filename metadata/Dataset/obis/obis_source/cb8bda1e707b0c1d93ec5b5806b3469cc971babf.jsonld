    "description": "Data on marine benthonic foraminifera were obtained from samples collected from the Hudson 2002-54, Hudson 2002-46, Martha Black 2001 ROPOS cruise and 1965 Sackville cruise by video grab, piston core, and sediment suction. Samples were collected from coral specimens ranging in height from 25-60cm in water depths from 300 to 500 m. Methods of collecting and processing samples vary with each cruise.\n\nThe original survey report (Hawkes 2004)also contains information on ocean current paths. The OBIS view of this dataset includes only the abundance and biomass information and the units have been standardized to number of individuals (or biomass) per cubic centimetre.",

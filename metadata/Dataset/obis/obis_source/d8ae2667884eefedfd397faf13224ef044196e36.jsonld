    "description": "Original provider:\nUniversity of Rhode Island\n\nDataset credits:\nUniversity of Rhode Island\nBureau of Land Management\nU.S. Dept of the Interior\n\nAbstract:\nThe Cetacean and Turtle Assessment Program (CETAP) was sponsored by the Bureau of Land Management and conducted between October 1978 and January 1982 by the University of Rhode Island in outer continental shelf waters of the northeastern United States from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, to the Gulf of Maine and from shore to 9.3 km (5 nautical miles) seaward of the 1829 m (1,000 fathoms) isobath. Population surveys were conducted by CETAP to assess the distribution and abundance of whales, dolphins and sea turtles inhabiting the study area.\n\nPurpose:\nThis dataset is a subset of CETAP_AIR extracting animal sighting records with taxonomic information of species sighted added. The full dataset may be available upon request. Please contact the primary contact person for the proper use of the dataset.\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2020-09-30] The following invalid species names were corrected according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS).\nTurtles: Testudines (173749) =&gt; Testudines (948936)\n\nMetadata are currently being revised. Sighting points that were more than 2 km inland were eliminated. Those from 1 km to 2 km inland can be considered as on-water sightings. Those records have TRUE in the [Excluded] field to indicate that they seem to fall on land but may be correct sightings.",

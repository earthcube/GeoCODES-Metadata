By January 2003, Fisher had reached 90 pounds and measured over 2 feet in length.  Outgrowing his Fort Fisher home, the now sub-adult loggerhead was loaned to the Newport Aquarium in Kentucky, USA, to be featured in Turtles: Journey of Survival.  When the turtle exhibit ended in spring of this year, Newport staff realized that it was time to say goodbye to Fisher and return him to the wild.  Now a formidable 150 pounds, Fisher would be of great value to the wild populations of sea turtles. This is Fishers first ever exposure to the wild and it will be fascinating to see what happens!\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=33\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

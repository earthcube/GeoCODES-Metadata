    "description": "The basis of the zoological collections of the QVMAG was formed from the Launceston Mechanics' Institute, which opened in 1842. Many exotic species, mainly mounted specimens, were acquired during the early years as a result of exchanges with other museums around the world.\n\nThe collection was established in 1842 and continues to the present.\nThis dataset is of marine species sourced from the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) January 2019 (https://collections.ala.org.au/public/show/co156).\nTaxa have been matched to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) and if not then matched to the Australian Faunal Directory (AFD)",

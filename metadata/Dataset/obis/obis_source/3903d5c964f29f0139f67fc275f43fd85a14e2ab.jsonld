    "name": "Common Diving petrel  (Pelecanoides urinatrix) tracking from Kauwahaia Island and Burgess Island near Auckland, New Zealand (2010-2012)",
    "description": "Adult P. urinatrix were studied at two colonies within the Auckland region of New Zealand, namely Kauwahaia Island (36° 53′ 13″ S, 174° 26′ 12″ E) on Auckland’s west coast and in the Tasman Sea, and Burgess (Pokohinau) Island of the Mokohinau Island group (35° 54′ 10″ S, 175° 07′ 05″ E) within the Hauraki Gulf (Figure 1). Breeding adults were captured by hand from marked study burrows during late incubation (Burgess Island, n = 7) or chick rearing\n(Kauwahaia, n = 5) and tracked using geolocation-immersion loggers from the British Antarctic Survey.\nData and metadata from Zoatrack (https://zoatrack.org) projects 108 and 111 accessed on 2021-06-01",

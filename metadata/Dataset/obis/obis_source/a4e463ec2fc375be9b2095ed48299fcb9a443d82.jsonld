    "description": "Amplicon sequencing dataset (454 pyrosequencing) of microbial diversity (Bacteria, based on the 16S ssu rRNA gene) in the Amundsen Sea Polynya. This dataset was used in a study where the Amundsen Sea Polynya (Southern Ocean) was used as a model system to investigate important environmental factors that shape the coastal Southern Ocean microbiota. Population dynamics of abundant taxa was studied in both environmental samples and microcosm experiments.",

    "description": "This dataset contains occurrences of HAB species in the Mediterranean found in literature.\n\nProtoceratium reticulatum is considered uncertain in all cases when molecular or toxin data are lacking: in these cases it could be the species Pentaplacodinium saltoense/Ceratocorys mariaovidiorum. Chattonella subsalsa from Sardinia includes 2 genotypes. Pseudo-nitzschia seriata is not in in the Mediterranean Sea, all records were uploaded as \"Pseudo-nitzschia\". Ostreopsis ovata is changed to  Ostreopsis cf. ovata in all records, since the type material is not available and so the proper identification of the species is not possible. Dinophysis acuminata has been considered \"probable\" since the presence of this species in the Mediterranean Sea is not clear.",

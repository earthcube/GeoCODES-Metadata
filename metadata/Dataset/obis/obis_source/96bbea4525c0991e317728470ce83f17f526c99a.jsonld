    "description": "This dataset is from a paper by Bratcher (1980) on a new Indo-Pacific Terebrid.\nIn 1969 an unusual terebrid was dredged from 300 m in Hawaii by E. R. Cross. Though subsequent research showed it to be a new species, there was a hesitancy in describing it on the basis of a single specimen, particularly as the protoconch was missing. Since that time other specimens of the same species have been sent to me for identification from several areas of the tropical Indo-Pacific.\nBecause E. R. Cross was the instructor of my first course in underwater safety and is a longtime friend, because of his years as editor of the Hawaiian Shell News, and because he discovered the first specimen of this new species, I now take pleasure in naming it in his honor.",

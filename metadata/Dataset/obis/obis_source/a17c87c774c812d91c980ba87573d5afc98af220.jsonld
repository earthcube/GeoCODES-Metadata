    "description": "The Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Pacific Region Institute of Ocean Science (IOS) Zooplankton Database is a MS Access Application for data entry, storage, and retrieval of zooplankton and related data. This OBIS resource contains a small subset of species distribution records extracted from the IOS database. \n\n\nThe 'Arctic pre2001' dataset contains records of zooplankton collected during IOS cruises (8770, 9207, 9324, 9470, 9526, 9924, 0022) to the arctic between 1987 to 2000. Some of the samples were collected through the ice using a collapsing  or hinged frame on a modified SCOR net the rest were vertical Bongo net hauls.",

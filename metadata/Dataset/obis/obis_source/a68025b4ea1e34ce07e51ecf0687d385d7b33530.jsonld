    "description": "This is a historical dataset that was published in 1939 by H. Harant and concerns of the faunistic report on the Ascidiacea collected during the floristical and faunistical survey of Adolf Steuer on the coasts near Alexandria mainly with the vessel “El Hoot”. This dataset contains occurrence data of Ascidiacea in the coasts of Alexandria, Egypt. Temporal coverage for this dataset is not described in the historical paper but only in the preliminary report of the expedition. Thus, it is assumed that the sample collection was done in the autumn of 1933 (beggining from the end of August to end of November).The digitization of this dataset was done by LifewatchGreece team.",

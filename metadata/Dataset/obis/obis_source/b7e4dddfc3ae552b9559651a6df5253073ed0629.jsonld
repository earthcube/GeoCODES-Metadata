The dataset is global in coverage.\n\nPurpose:\nThe Royal Navy often operates in remote areas and the purpose of collecting this sort of data is to contribute to a better scientific understanding of cetacean distributions, breeding areas, migration routes, etc. By ensuring that Royal Navy personnel keep watch for cetaceans helps them to comply with current risk mitigation measures.\n\nSupplemental information:\n12/07/06: Observations for <i>Lagenorhynchus acutus</i> (180443: Atlantic white-sided dolphin) that are located in the Southern Hemisphere were replaced with <i>Lagenorhynchus </i>(180441: white-side dolphin)",

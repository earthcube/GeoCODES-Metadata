    "description": "A fundamental goal in ecology is to understand how environmental drivers affect patterns and processes, and ultimately ecosystem functioning. The effect of single local factors on populations and communities has long been documented but less is understood on the influence of simultaneous environmental drivers emerging at multiple spatial scales. The importance of environmental drivers as mediators of cascade trophic effects and direct regulation of rocky shore populations is subject of vast literature for temperate regions where these landscapes are conspicuous. Despite of that, other regions on tropical and subtropical domains are poorly explored, including the Southwest Atlantic coasts. Knowledge about such ecological patterns is key to access ecological function and ecosystem functioning, allowing predictive capacity and managing of natural systems. Thus, the activities of this project focused on issues related to the assessment of spatial variation at multiple scales of producers and consumers and their association with the composition and population structure of intertidal organisms on rocky shores in SE Brazil. To achieve that, the geographical area covered by the project extended from the north of Rio de Janeiro to the south of SÃ£o Paulo, comprising a broad gradient of productivity, coastal complexity and anthropic impact. This collection corresponds to the species registered on benthic fauna of 62 rocky shores from spanning 530 km of coasts using standardized sampling protocols using a nested hierarchical design. This dataset comprises measurements of individual size, density or relative cover of dominant species found in intertidal rocky shores in SE Brazil coast sampled in 2015. Species include filter feeders (mussel Mytilaster solisianus, barnacles Tetraclita stalactifera and Chthamalus bisinuatus), a predatory gastropod (whelk Stramonita haemastoma) and grazers (limpets Lottia subrugosa and Fissurela rosea, and periwinkle Echinolittorina lineolata). Sampling, materials and personnel were financed by grants provided by CNPq and FAPESP (Brazil).",

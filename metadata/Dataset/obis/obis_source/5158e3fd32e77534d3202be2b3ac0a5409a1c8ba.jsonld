    "description": "Original provider:\nVirginia Aquarium Stranding Response Program\n\nDataset credits:\nData provider\nVirginia Aquarium Stranding Response Program\nOriginating data center\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/\">Satellite Tracking and Analysis Tool (STAT)</a>\nProject partner\nThe Virginia Aquarium &amp; Marine Science Center and Seaturtle.org work in partnership to promote the conservation of marine life and our marine environment. Sea turtles rehabilitated, tagged with satellite transmitters, and released into the Atlantic Ocean by the Virginia Aquarium are tracked on Seaturtle.org. Seaturtle.org provides the satellite tracking service for the Virginia Aquarium. Seaturtle.org accepts donations, including turtle adoptions, to help fund the satellite tracking service. The Virginia Aquarium accepts donations to provide response, rehabilitation, and care for stranded sea turtles and marine mammals, and to conduct research related to sea turtles and marine mammals (http://www.virginiaaquarium.com/get-involved/Pages/donate.aspx).\nProject sponsor or sponsor description\nThis program is supported by the Virginia Aquarium &amp; Marine Science Center Foundation and would not be possible without assistance from Virginia Coastal Zone Management Program at the Department of Environmental Quality and NOAA Fisheries Service.\n\n\nAbstract:\nThe mission of the Virginia Aquarium Stranding Response Program (VAQS) is to promote the conservation of marine animal species through response, research, rehabilitation and education.    The VAQS is largely a volunteer-based group (the Stranding Team) operating from a Stranding Center located in Virginia Beach. Stranding Team personnel are permitted by state and federal authorities to respond to marine mammal and sea turtle strandings.  The Stranding Response Program is supported by the donations of goods and services from the community and grant-making organizations.    To report a dead or live stranded marine mammal or sea turtle in Virginia, call the VAQS hotline at 757-437-6159.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=222\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

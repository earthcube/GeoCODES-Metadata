    "description": "From 2010 -2013 marine fish specimens were collected from local fish market and fish landing station all around Mauritius mainland. For each specimen collected, the morphometric data as well as the sampling location and date of collection were recorded. Each specimen was tagged with a unique identification number and photographed. Tissue samples were dissected from the body muscle for DNA extraction.  Each fish specimen was tentatively identified by an ichthyologist based on the morphological features. \nAll vouchered specimens collected were deposited at the Mauritius Oceanography Institute and preserved in 10% formaldehyde or kept as frozen",

    "description": "The Bras d'Or “Lakes” are actually a complex estuary occupying the central part of Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia. Measuring 1,200km2 in surface area and 13 km3 in volume, it consists of four basins, running in a northeast-southwest direction, separated by a series of low mountains, and connected by narrow channels, including two that open to the NE Atlantic ocean.\n\nSpecies distribution information associated with a study of marine algae (McLachlan and Edelstein, 1990) were digitized, standardized and republished by Cape Breton University (CBU) as as part of the Atlantic Coastal Zone Information Steering Committee (ACZISC) Atlantic Ecosystem Initiative (AEI) funded project “Atlantic Canada’s Biological Data for Ecosystem Planning and Decision-making” and OBIS Canada.\n\nThis resource contains species presence information and is a republication of data originally reported by McLachlan and Edelestein, 1971.",

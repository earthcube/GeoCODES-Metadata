Satellite transmitters attached in the 2007 and 2008 nesting seasons have been funded by the Large Pelagics Research Centre (University of New Hampshire) through National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Agency award NA04NMF4550391. Earlier phases of this project were made possible by funding receieved from the <a href=\"http://www.nerc.ac.uk\">Natural Environment Research Council, UK </a>.\n\n\nAbstract:\nThis project uses satellite telemetry to gain insights into the behaviour of female leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) nesting at <a href=\"http://www.mayumbanationalpark.com\">Mayumba National Park</a> in Gabon, a globally important rookery. The project has now entered into its third year of tracking. See the <a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/cgi-bin/imagelib/index.pl?cat=612&amp;thumb=1\"> photo library</a> for this project.This work compliments that carried out by <a href=\"http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/where_we_work/latin_america_and_caribbean/our_solutions/marine_turtle_programme/projects/leatherback_tracking_project/tracking_logs/index.cfm\"> WWF</a>, which studied adults from a range of locations throughout the Atlantic as part of a basin wide project.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=270\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

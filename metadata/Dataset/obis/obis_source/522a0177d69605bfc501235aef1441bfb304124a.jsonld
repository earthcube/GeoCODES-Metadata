    "name": "Habitat and fisheries production in the south east fishery ecosystem - Zooplankton records from three Southern Surveyor voyages, shelf waters, South East Australia (1994-1996)",
    "description": "Zooplankton were collected by bongo and/or drop nets at 40m and 200m stations on seven transects across the continental shelf in eastern Bass Strait, south-west Victoria, and south-west NSW waters. Data were collected in July 1993 (cruise SS 05/93), August 1994 (cruise SS 05/94), April 1996 (cruise SS 02/96) and November 1996 (cruise SS 06/96). Major species/species groups were identified, biomass measured, and subsamples taken for stable isotope analysis. Zooplankton communities identified will be analysed for links to water masses, water column phytoplankton pigments, and nutrient levels in the water.",

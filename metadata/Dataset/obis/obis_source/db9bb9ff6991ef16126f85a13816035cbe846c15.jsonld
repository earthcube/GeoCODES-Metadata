    "description": "Original provider:\nMinerals Management Service\n\nDataset credits:\nMinerals Management Service\n\nAbstract:\nThis dataset is from the California seabird ecology study studies: Seabird ecology study [birds and mammals] study code: SE, Contract number: 14-12-001-30183, Principal Investigator: Kenneth T. Briggs, Institute of Marine Sciences, University of California, Santa Cruz. Portions of this work were done by D. G. Ainley and others at Point Reyes Bird Observatory, Stinson Beach, CA, and by L. B. Spear and others at Science Applications International Corporation, Monterey, CA. \n\nTime period: 1984 through 1987\n\nStudy area: Area of study included all waters of California, focusing on the continental shelf near large nesting colonies off Point St. George, in the Gulf of the Farallones, and in the Southern California Bight. Field studies were conducted from Monterey Bay to about Bodega Head. \n\nMethodology: Surveys of seabird abundance and distribution were done by aircraft and by ship. Data collection protocols for aerial surveys were identical with those used for the Central and Northern California Marine Mammal and Seabird Surveys. Protocols for ship surveys were identical with those of the Marine Mammal and Seabird Studies of the Southern California Bight with the following exception: the searched strip extended 300 m at right-angle to the ship's heading, and observers recorded distance from the vessel in three equal zones of 100 m; sightings beyond were recorded as 'off-transect.' Four aerial surveys and three vessel surveys were conducted in the spring and summer of 1985. \n\nDatabases produced: Results of four aerial surveys and one ship survey are included in the database. All focus on the distribution and abundance of seabirds in waters from Monterey Bay to the Gulf of the Farallones in spring and summer of 1985.\nSurvey 601, March 12-13, 1985 \nSurvey 602, March 21, 1985 \nSurvey 603, May 10, 1985 \nSurvey 604, May 27-28, 1985 \nSurvey 703, May 31 to June 17, 1985 \n\nEffort data for aerial surveys consist of start-stop pairs of coordinates (date/time, latitude, and longitude); sightings have been assigned a position interpolated from the time of the observation. For ship data, the location of each sighting within 0.5 km was available in digital form (the center of a 1 km segment along the ship's track in which the sighting occurred).\n\nPurpose:\nTo study the feeding and foraging ecology of seabirds nesting in California through: \n1) Synthesis of the existing literature, \n2) Analysis of unpublished data on diet, feeding behavior, and distribution of flocks, \n3) Identification of data gaps, and \n4) Conduct of additional studies to map seabird distribution and describe correlative oceanographic conditions.\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2020-09-30] The following invalid species names were corrected according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS).\nBonaparte's Gull: Larus philadelphia (176839) =&gt; Chroicocephalus philadelphia (824040)\nCaspian Tern: Sterna caspia (176924) =&gt; Hydroprogne caspia (176935)\nLarus sabini (176865) =&gt; Xema sabini (176866)\nLarus tridactyla (176874) =&gt; Rissa tridactyla (176875)\nPhalacrocorax olivaceus (174722) =&gt; Phalacrocorax brasilianus brasilianus (824220)",

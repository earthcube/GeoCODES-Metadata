    "description": "Original provider:\nMare Nostrum\n\nDataset credits:\nMare Nostrum NGO, National Institute for Marine Research and Development \"Grigore Antipa\"\n\nAbstract:\nIn the Black Sea, the cetaceans are represented by three species, <i>Phocoena phocoena relicta</i>, <i>Tursiops truncatus ponticus</i> and <i>Delphinus delphis ponticus</i>. The main threat and cause of decline for the Black Sea dolphins are the fishing nets, or bycatches.\n\nFor protection of the dolphin populations from Romanian Black Sea area in conformity with the objectives of the \"National Action Plan for Conservation of Dolphins\" and \"Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans of the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and contiguous Atlantic Area,\" with financial support from European Union through the Sectorial Operational Programme – Environment, the NGO \"Mare Nostrum\" started a series of activities in partnership with National Institute for Marine Research and Development \"Grigore Antipa\" Constanța, Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve Authority, National Agency for Fishing and Aquaculture, Natural Science Museum Complex \"Dolphinarium\" Constanța, Border Police Inspectorate of Constanța County. And in 2012, Mare Nostrum continued collecting data through two projects: one financed through the ACCOBAMS Secretariat fund and one through a CSR private company. The present database presents the situation of dolphin strandings along the Romanian coast during 2010 and 2012. The data were collected from the entire Romanian coast, from Sulina to Vama Veche.\n\nPurpose:\nThe purpose of this research was to monitor the situation of Black Sea dolphins at the Romanian coast.\n\nSupplemental information:\n[UPDATE] Data in 2016 were added on 2017-02-08. \n[UPDATE] Data in 2015 were added on 2016-03-04. \n[UPDATE] Data in 2014 were added on 2015-01-23. \nA few existing 2013 records got coordinates fixed.\nThe stranding in 2002 was fixed to 2012.\n\n[UPDATE] Data in 2013 were added on 2014-02-20\n\nAdditional references:\nPaiu, M., E.

    "description": "Original provider:\nVirginia Aquarium &amp; Marine Science Center Foundation\n\nDataset credits:\nData provider\nVirginia Aquarium Research and Conservation Department\nOriginating data center\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/\">Satellite Tracking and Analysis Tool (STAT)</a>\nProject partner\nVAQF is working with U.S. Fleet Forces Command and Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) Atlantic to track juvenile loggerhead, Kempâ€™s ridley and green sea turtles using a combination of satellite and acoustic transmitters. Funding for this work is provided by U.S. Fleet Forces Command. VAQF and NAVFAC Atlantic will analyze the telemetry data in order to understand how sea turtles use the Chesapeake Bay and neritic Virginia waters.\n\n\nAbstract:\nThe Virginia Aquarium &amp; Marine Science Center Foundation is conducting health assessment and telemetry research using wild-caught and by-caught loggerhead and Kemps ridley sea turtles.  The project goals include comparing rehabilitated and wild animals, developing a relatively fine temporal and spatial scale surface time ratio for abundance estimates, and understanding how near shore and offshore populations interact and utilize the habitat.  (NMFS Permit No. 16134)\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=917\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

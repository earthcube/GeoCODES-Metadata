    "description": "Diet data from 1050 individual seabirds covering 17 species were collected in the northern end of the Great Barrier Reef in the period 1992 to 1994. Each occurrence record is one instance of collecting prey from a seabird where the prey was identified, length, wet weight and sometimes dry weight were measured. Otoliths from 50% of the samples were weighed and measured for length.",

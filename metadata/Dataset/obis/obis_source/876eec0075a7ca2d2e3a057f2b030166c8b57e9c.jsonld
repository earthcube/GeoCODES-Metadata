The first flatback turtles to be satellite tracked in Western Australia were released from Barrow Island in 2005 and since that time flatback turtles have been tracked annually from Barrow and from Mundabullangana Station on the mainland.  All proceeds from the adoption program for these animals are being donated to seaturtle.org\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=457\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

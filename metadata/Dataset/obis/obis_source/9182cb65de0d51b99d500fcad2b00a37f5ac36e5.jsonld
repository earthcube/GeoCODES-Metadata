    "description": "The Ornithology Collection contains more than 70 000 specimens of mounted birds, skins, skeletons, eggs and specimens preserved in alcohol.\nOne of the largest Australian avian collections, primarily of Australian species and with a strong Victorian emphasis, it includes material from a broad spectrum of the worldâ€™s avifauna and represents in excess of 4000 species. Many are of great historical significance, especially those purchased from John Gould in the mid-19th century.\nOne of the largest collections in Australia, it includes material from early explorative trips through central and northern Australia. There are also representatives of many birds now long extinct. The collection contains valuable type specimens.\nThis subset of marine birds was downloaded from Atlas of Living Australia on Sun Apr 23 23:11:05 UTC 2017. The taxa havebeen matched to the World Register of Marine Species.",

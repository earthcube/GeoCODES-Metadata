    "description": "Original provider:\nNational Marine Mammal Laboratory\n\nDataset credits:\nNational Marine Mammal Laboratory\n\nAbstract:\nFrom 9 July to 22 August, 1992, a part of a larger study, the waters surrounding Kodiak Island were surveyed for killer whales (<i>Orcinus orca</i>) from the NOAA Brielyn Marie using line transect methodology. To provide adequate coverage throughout the area, the study was limited to areas of known killer whale concentrations. The vessel was 36.5 m (113 ft) long and had a bridge height of 6.0 m (18.5 feet).\n\nPurpose:\nThe objectives of this study were as follows: \n1) Develop a photographic identification catalogue of each killer whale encountered, and its pod, to determine pod identity, distribution, and movements relative to annual survey effort, \n2) Obtain minimum population estimated of killer whales in the central/eastern Aleutians and the south side of the Alaskan peninsula, \n3) Establish baseline data for detecting annual changes in abundance.\n\nSupplemental information:\nThis dataset and associated effort data were updated on September 8, 2005. Those who downloaded them before that date should renew them.",

Ford, NOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center\n\nAbstract:\nAn Atlantic Ocean ship survey was conducted by NOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center in 1992 to study marine mammals and pelagic apex predators. The primary area of operation was in the Blake Plateau area of the Atlantic Ocean between 28 degree and 35 degree North latitude and from the coastal boundary to the Exclusive Economic Zone.\nDuring 28 survey days, at least 10 cetacean species were sighted, including:\n1) Atlantic spotted dolphin\n2) Cuvier's beaked whale\n3) Dwarf sperm whale\n4) False killer whale\n5) Pantropical spotted dolphin\n6) Pygmy killer whale\n7) Globicephala sp.\n8) Sperm whale\n9) Spinner dolphin\n10) Standard Bottlenose dolphin\nThe dataset is accompanied by transect data which is provided as a separate file.\n\nPurpose:\nThe purpose of this survey is to examine the distribution and estimate abundance of cetaceans in U.S. waters.\nSpecific objectives of this survey are:\n1. Complete a line-transect survey of the study area for marine mammals during the daylight hours, following prescribed course transects.\n2. Deploy longline fishing gear during the evening hours for the propose of catching and sampling pelagic apex predators (primarily swordfish, other billfish, tunas, and sharks).\n3. Collect associated oceanographic data.\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2020-09-30] The following invalid species names were corrected according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS).\nBonaparte's Gull: Larus philadelphia (176839) =&gt; Chroicocephalus philadelphia (824040)\nBridled Tern: Sterna anaethetus (176897) =&gt; Onychoprion anaethetus (824104)\nLaughing Gull: Larus atricilla (176837) =&gt; Leucophaeus atricilla (824079)\nRed Phalarope: Phalaropus fulicaria (554376) =&gt; Phalaropus fulicarius (176734)\nRoyal Tern: Sterna maxima (176922) =&gt; Thalasseus maximus (824142)\nSooty Tern: Sterna fuscata (176894) =&gt; Onychoprion fuscatus (824105)",

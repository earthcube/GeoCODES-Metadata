    "description": "Original provider:\nBureau of Ocean Energy Management\n\nDataset credits:\nTexas A&amp;M University\nOregon State University\nScripps Institution of Oceanography\nTexas A&amp;M University-Galveston\nUniversity of Colorado\nUniversity of Durham\nUniversity of Saint Andrews\nUniversity of South Florida\nWoods Hole Oceanographic Institution\n\nAbstract:\nSperm Whale Seismic Study (SWSS) was a multi-institutional, interdisciplinary research project supported by the then Minerals Management Service (MMS; now Bureau of Ocean Energy Management - BOEM) under Cooperative Agreement 1435-01-02-CA-85186 for Cooperative Research on Sperm Whales and their Response to Seismic Exploration in the Gulf of Mexico through the Texas A&amp;M Research Foundation.\n\nThe objectives of SWSS were to\n(1) establish baseline information on the biology and behavior of sperm whales in the northern Gulf of Mexico,\n(2) characterize sperm whale habitat use in the northern Gulf of Mexico, and\n(3) determine possible changes in behavior of sperm whales when subjected to manmade noise, particularly from seismic airgun arrays used for offshore oil and gas exploration and geological monitoring.\n\nSupplemental information:\nThis dataset includes sperm whale visual tracking data and sightings of other cetaceans in 2005. Since the vessels often tracked the sighted sperm whales for further surveys, many sightings in this dataset represent the same animals.\n\nCetacean sightings in 2002-2004 are found in <a href=\"/dataset/903\">BOEM Sperm Whale Seismic Study (SWSS) S-Tag cetacean sightings 2002-2004</a>\n\nSperm whale visual trackings in 2002-2004 are found in <a href=\"/dataset/904\">BOEM Sperm Whale Seismic Study (SWSS) S-Tag sperm whale trackings 2002-2004</a>\n\nEffort data were filtered to eliminate early morning and night times where no visual efforts were conducted. The of-effort times was\n2005: 07:00 â€“ 20:00 CDT",

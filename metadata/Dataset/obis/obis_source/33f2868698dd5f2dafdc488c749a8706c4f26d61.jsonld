    "description": "Timed searches undertaken by the Marine Biological Association (MBA) to search for non-native species in the Yealm Estuary. Searches primarily focused on the Pacific Oyster (Magallana gigas), although other non-natives were recorded. Abundance was primarily Present/Not present, but in some cases non-standard units of abundance (eg. Not common) were used.",

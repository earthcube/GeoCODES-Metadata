    "description": "AATAMS represents the higher biological monitoring of the marine environment for the IMOS program. This record presents data collected from tagged and recaptured Short-tailed shearwaters (Puffinus tenuirostris), with data presented throughout the Southern Ocean. The study was initially conducted on Wedge Island (43 km2), southern Tasmania (43o 07' S, 147o 40' E). Fifty geolocation archival (GLS) tag deployments were made on 34 adult birds in the pre-laying exodus (n = 18), incubation (n = 12) and early chick-rearing (ECR) phases (n = 20). In 2012, 12 birds were tracked during the pre-laying exodus. GLS tags were deployed between the 10th and the 18th of October. Ten birds were tracked from Wedge Island (as in 2010) and 2 were tracked from Whalebone Point, Bruny Island (43.44 South, 147.23 East; birds 22 and 80)",

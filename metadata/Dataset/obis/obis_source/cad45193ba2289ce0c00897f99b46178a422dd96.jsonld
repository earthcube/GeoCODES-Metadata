    "description": "Original provider:\nOceanic Society\n\nDataset credits:\nOceanic Society, CUNY Hunter College\n\nAbstract:\nIn 1992 Oceanic Society began a study aimed at documenting the abundance, distribution, and behavioral ecology of bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>) in Belize. Our study site is Turneffe Atoll, a non-volcanic carribbean atoll ~40km east of Belize City with more than 200 mangrove cayes and surrounded by fringing coral reef. The atoll encloses a brackish lagoon whose shallow waters are the home to a population of bottlenose dolphins. To date more than a 175 dolphins have been identified in this region through photo-identification methods on surveys and follows. Studies on their abundance and distribution, habitat use, side-fidelity, and social affiliations have been conducted over the years since our work began.\n\nFrom 1997 to 2001 researchers at OS conducted a study of the population of bottlenose dolphins located at the Drowned Cayes 8 km off the coast of Belize City. The close proximity of these regions suggested the possibility of overlap, yet only 3 were matched to both sites spurring more questions about the home ranges of dolphin populations in Belize. All research is conducted from small boats inside the atoll.\n\nPurpose:\nPhoto-identification methods are used to track sightings of individuals who are recognizable through dorsal fin scarring. Some of our current research goals include the study of social and acoustic behavior in the dolphin population in this atoll conducted from small boats Of particular interest is the subset of the population classified as residents who demonstrate a side fidelity of nearly 20 years.\nLocated at the southernmost tip of Blackbird Caye researchers and partners of OS engage in scientific research on various aspects of the ecology and biodiversity of this complex and productive habitat. Some research has included the study of abundance and distribution of American crocodiles (<i>Crocdylus acutus</i>), sea turtles presence and nesting sites, and monitoring coral reef health. Antillean manatees (<i>Trichechus manatus manatus</i>) are also encountered in certain regions of Turneffe Atoll. Oceanic Society is partnered with researchers who conduct boat and aerial surveys for manatees.\nMuch remains to be understood cetacean abundance and distribution in this region as other cetaceans including Short-finned Pilot whales (<i>Globicephala marcorhyncus</i>) and  Atlantic-spotted dolphins (<i>Stenella frontalis</i>) are occasionally sighted beyond just at the bounds of Turneffe Atoll.",

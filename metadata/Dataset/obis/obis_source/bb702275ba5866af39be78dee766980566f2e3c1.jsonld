    "description": "Over the last 15 years a deliberate effort has been made to increase holdings of invertebrate specimens in the collections and to register and database existing material. There are currently approximately 75000 registered lots, most are of Tasmanian in origin. (We also house a large collection of unsorted and unregistered invertebrate material donated as a result of various fauna surveys around Tasmania).\n\nThe collection was established in 1842 and continues to the present.\nThis dataset is of marine species sourced from the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) January 2019 (https://collections.ala.org.au/public/show/co258). Taxa have been matched to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) and if not then matched to the Australian Faunal Directory (AFD)",

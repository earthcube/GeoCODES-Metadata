    "description": "In September and October 2014, 2015 and 2016, 4.5 g solar Platform Terminal Transmitters (PTTs, Microwave Telemetry) were deployed on great knots (Calidris tenuirostris) captured with cannon nets at a primary non‐breeding site, the northern beaches of Roebuck Bay, Broome, Northwest Australia (17.98°S, 122.31°E). From the great knot tracks, a total of 92 stopping sites along the East Asian–Australasian Flyway (EAAF) were identified. Surprisingly, 63% of these sites were not known as important shorebird sites before our study; in fact, every one of the tracked individuals used sites that were previously unrecognized. This datasets also includes site counts at 8 locations visited by the tracked birds. Data accessed  from cited paper on 2022-08-01.",

    "description": "Original provider:\nHDR Environmental, Operations and Construction, Inc.\n\nDataset credits:\nThe U.S. Navy Marine Species Monitoring Program\n\nAbstract:\nAerial surveys to monitor marine mammals and sea turtles (MM/ST) were conducted in\nconjunction with two training events during the period February 16 to March 5, 2011, including\n(a) U.S. Navy Submarine Commanderâ€™s Course (SCC) naval training event in the Hawaii Range\nComplex (HRC) on the Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF) instrumented range between Kauai\nand Niihau, Hawaii; and \n(b) Undersea Warfare Exercise (USWEX) training event south of Oahu\nand Molokai. Surveys in support of the SCC event occurred on 4 consecutive days from\nFebruary 16 to 19, 2011, in waters adjoining Kauai and Niihau where the missile destroyer (DDG)\nand other ships were operating, followed by shoreline surveys of Kauai and Niihau on 2 separate\ndays thereafter: February 24 and 26, 2011. This was followed by shoreline surveys of the Four\nIslands region in support of the USWEX event on 2 separate days, February 28 and March 5, 2011.\nThe survey methods and sampling design were submitted and approved in advance, per the\nstatement of work (SOW), to the Navy Technical Representative (NTR) and followed previously\nestablished protocol (Mobley and Milette 2010; Smultea et al. 2009a,b).\n\nPurpose:\nnot provided\n\nSupplemental information:\nThis dataset includes sightings during the transect surveys.\n\nSightings during the ship-follow surveys are available:\n[2017-10-13] Data fields are changed so that they follow other Navy datasets.\n\n<a href=\"http://seamap.env.duke.edu/dataset/922\">HRC SCC Aerial-based Shp-follow Surveys  February 2011</a>\n\nDatasets for the shoreline surveys are available:\n<a href=\"http://seamap.env.duke.edu/dataset/924\">HRC SCC Aerial-based Shoreline Surveys  February 2011</a>\n<a href=\"http://seamap.env.duke.edu/dataset/925\">HRC USWEX Aerial-based Shoreline Surveys  February and March 2011</a>",

    "description": "The Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory (MAGNT) Ascidian Collection was established in 1981 and consists of about 750 databased specimens. The majority of the specimens have been collected from locations in Northern Australia. The collection includes 19 holotypes and 4 paratypes. The collection mainly focuses on shallow water tropical species, and includes a large amount of material identified by Dr P. Kott.\nThis dataset was sourced from the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) January 2019 (https://collections.ala.org.au/public/show/co209). Taxa have been matched to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) and if not then matched to the Australian Faunal Directory (AFD)",

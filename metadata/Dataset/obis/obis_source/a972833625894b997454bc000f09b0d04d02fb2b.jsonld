    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nCarol Roden, NOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center\n\nAbstract:\nA Eastern Gulf of Mexico cetacean survey was conducted  in 1994 by NOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center to examine the distribution and estimate abundance of cetaceans in U.S. waters. This dataset contains sightings of not only cetaceans but also other species including sea turtles, fish and shark observed during the ship survey.\n\nSighted species numbers 299 herds composed of 4,370 total individual animals, including\n\nAtlantic spotted dolphin\nClymene dolphin\nCuvierâ€™s beaked whale\nHardshell\nKemp's ridley\nLeatherback\nLoggerhead\nPantropical spotted dolphin\nRisso's dolphin\nRough-toothed dolphin\nSperm whale\nSpinner dolphin\nStandard Bottlenose dolphin\nStriped dolphin\n\nThe dataset  is accompanied by transect data which is provided as a separate file.\n\nPurpose:\nThe purpose of this survey is to examine the distribution and estimate abundance of cetaceans in U.S. waters, which should meet the responsibility under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act.\nSpecific objectives of this survey are:\n\n1. Collect data to estimate abundances and define the distributions of marine mammals in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.\n\n2. Collect associated environmental data at designated stations.\n\n3. Obtain biopsy samples of skin and blubber from selected cetacean species.\n\n4. Conduct a shallow water (10 to 20 fathoms) experiment on dolphin attraction to a vessel.\n\n5. Collect data on the distribution and abundance of sea turtles, seabirds and other marine life.\n\n6. Collect data on the distribution and type of marine debris encountered during the survey.\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2020-09-30] The following invalid species names were corrected according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS).\nBridled Tern: Sterna anaethetus (176897) =&gt; Onychoprion anaethetus (824104)\nCaspian Tern: Sterna caspia (176924) =&gt; Hydroprogne caspia (176935)\nLaughing Gull: Larus atricilla (176837) =&gt; Leucophaeus atricilla (824079)\nLeast Tern: Sterna antillarum (176923) =&gt; Sternula antillarum (824127)\nRoyal Tern: Sterna maxima (176922) =&gt; Thalasseus maximus (824142)\nSandwich Tern: Sterna sandvicensis (176927) =&gt; Thalasseus sandvicensis (176932)\nSooty Tern: Sterna fuscata (176894) =&gt; Onychoprion fuscatus (824105)",

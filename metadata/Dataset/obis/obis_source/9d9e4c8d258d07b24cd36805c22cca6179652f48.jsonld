    "description": "Processes during the meroplanktonic phase regulate population dynamics for many marine benthic invertebrates. A Canadian Healthy Oceans Network population connectivity project examined changes in vertical distribution of different meroplanktonic larvae in a coastal embayment during a stable period, at high temporal frequencies and spatial resolutions. Meroplanktonic invertebrate larvae (Margarites spp., Crepidula spp., Astyris lunata, Diaphana minuta, Littorinimorpha,  Arrhoges occidentalis, lyanassa spp., Bittiolum  alternatum, Nudibranchia, Gastropods, Bivalves, Bryozoans, Brachyurans, Polychaetes, Carideans, and Asteroids) were collected off a boat at 6 depths (3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 m) using a pump, every 2-h over a 36-h (6-7 Aug 2009) and a 25-h (12-13 Aug 2009) period, during a spring and neap tide respectively, concurrently with measures of temperature, salinity, fluorescence and current velocity in St. George's Bay, NS, Canada.",

    "description": "Original provider:\nDensity Estimation of Cetaceans from passive Acoustic Fixed sensors (DECAF)\n\nAbstract:\nThis archive contains data on echolocation clicks of Blainville's beaked whale (Mesoplodon densirostris) recorded at AUTEC during a 6-day period in spring 2005. The data were used in estimating M. densirostris density as documented in the paper Marques et al. (2009). There are data files containing click counts per minute per hydrophone, files containing numbers of false positive detections from a manual analysis, and files giving information about georeferenced tracks of tagged whales and associated vocalization timings.\n\nSupplemental information:\nEach record represents the georeferenced echolocation click of a single tagged whale. Only regular clicks from the tagged whale are included. Time zone is GMT.\nAdditional attributes include pitch, roll, and heading of the tagged whale and data on presence or absence of detections of each click on nearby seafloor hydrophones.\nData on the presence or absence of DTAG clicks on nearby seafloor hydrophones are available at http://seamap.env.duke.edu/dataset/722.\nAutomated and manually verified click detections from 82 seafloor hydrophones in a related dataset are available at http://seamap.env.duke.edu/dataset/677.\n\n\nOriginal data can be downloaded at http://www.creem.st-and.ac.uk/decaf/decaf-data-files under Case Study 3: Beaked whale data",

Four nesting females were tracked each in 2003 through 2007 and made impressive movements north as far away as New Jersey, and south as far as the Florida Keys. Two of the transmitters from 2007 are still transmitting. The transmitters provided us with some interesting, novel and useful data about the migratory and foraging behaviour and natural history of the loggerhead sea turtle in this region. This summer's deployments will complement the results from previous years and provide us with a wider insight into North Carolina sea turtle biology.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=290\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

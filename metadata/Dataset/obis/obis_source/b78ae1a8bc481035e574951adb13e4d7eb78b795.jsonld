    "description": "Original provider:\nBrazil Trawl caught turtles\n\nDataset credits:\nData provider\nFisheries Bycatch Research Group\nOriginating data center\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/\">Satellite Tracking and Analysis Tool (STAT)</a>\n\n\nAbstract:\nThe continental shelf of Southern Brazil is an important feeding ground for loggerhead sea turtles and for fishing activities. This overlap leads to a high bycatch and mortality of this endangered sea turtle. The aim of this study, with the use of satellite telemetry, are to: i) determine the spatial and temporal patterns of sea turtles distribution in the area; ii) identify preferred areas of use by immature individuals on the continental shelf; and iii) determine the influence of environmental variables such as sea surface temperature and depth on the species distribution.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=843\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

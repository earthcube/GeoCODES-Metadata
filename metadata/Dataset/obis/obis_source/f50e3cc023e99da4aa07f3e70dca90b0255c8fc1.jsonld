    "description": "Juvenile scalloped hammerhead sharks were sampled in the Rewa River Estuary on the island of Viti Levu in Fiji. To capture the sharks, a 100 metre gillnet comprising 3-, 3.5- and 4-inch nylon monofilament mesh sizes was used. Gillnet soak times were either 1 or 2 hours, and dependent on prevailing sea and weather conditions. There was a total of fifteen deployments, beginning at 1700hrs. Life stage and sex of the individuals captured were recorded. \n\nThis dataset is part of the results of research by a Master of Science student at the University of the South Pacific (USP) in Suva, Fiji. The research was funded in part by the SciCOFish programme of the Pacific Community, and the Faculty Research Committee of the Faculty of Science, Technology and Environment (FSTE) at USP. Publication of this dataset was funded by the European Union (EU). \n\nWe are also grateful to GBIF, BID and VertNet for their support in mobilising this dataset.",

    "description": "This dataset summarises benthic surveys in Yanyuwa Sea Country. This data set shows that in Yanyuwa sea country in the Gulf of Carpentaria, that there is significant seagrass along the coastline. The inshore coastline seagrass continues from Rosie Creek to Robinson River, where King Ash Bay and Bing Bong has almost continuous, reasonably dense seagrass meadows. Seagrass cover is present around the north, east and southern intertidal areas of West Island. Around the northern side of Black Islet has seagrass as well as north areas of Skull Island. Watson Island has seagrass areas on the southern and eastern coastlines. Seagrass cover can be found on Centre Island on all sides, particularly on the east and western sides. Vanderlin Island has light seagrass cover mostly towards the southern tip. Species present in these regions include C. serrulate, E. acoroides, H. ovalis, H. uninervis.",

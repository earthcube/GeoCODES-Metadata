    "description": "The Southern Surveyor voyage SS 02/95 took place in the Gulf of Carpentaria during 13 February - 19 March 1995, under the leadership of John Salini. Biological data collected on this cruise include samples from 153 paired bycatch reduction device (BRD) prawn trawls, 4 multi-level beam trawls (MBT) and 43 environmentally friendly net (EFN) trawls. Clear video images of fish behaviour in the BRD codends of the prawn net and the EFN were also obtained. 130 fish specimens were collected for the Hobart Fish Taxonomy Group's Handbook of Commercial Fishes. Scombrids and cephalopds were collected for QDPI Fisheries. Tissue samples from L. malabaricus, L. sebae and other species were obtained for population genetic studies for the Hobart genetics group. Queensland Museum and AIMS collected sponges and invertebrates and two acoustic recordings of trawler noise and background fish sounds. 3 species of Thenus were collected for University of Queensland. 11 turtles were also tagged during prawn trawling.

    "description": "The MBON Pole to Pole of the Amaricas effort seeks to develop a framework for the collection, use and sharing of marine biodiversity data in a coordinated, standardized manner leveraging on existing infrastructure managed by the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS; IOC-UNESCO), the GEO Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON), and the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS). The MBON Pole to Pole aims to become a key resource for decision-making and management of living resource across countries in the Americas for reporting requirements under the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), Aichi Targets of the Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD), and the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\nThe Marine Sciences Lab (UNDECIMAR), of the University of the Republic, Uruguay, covers research disciplines ranging from marine ecology, population dynamics, community benthic ecology to analysis of sandy marine ecosystems. In this sense, some members of UNDECIMAR participate in the MBON Pole to Pole network since 2018.",

    "description": "Original provider:\nAPEM, Normandeau Associates\n\nDataset credits:\nBureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), Normandeau \nAssociates Inc., APEM Ltd.\n\nAbstract:\nNormandeau Associates, Inc., and APEM Inc. (Team) have been contracted \nby BOEM to complete quarterly high-altitude aerial digital surveys in a 12-\nmonth period. The Team proposes to conduct the first survey in May 2019 \nand complete all four surveys in the 2020 calendar year.\n\nThe South Atlantic Survey area (SASA) is defined as the area of the ocean \noff the coast of North and South Carolina out to the -30-m contour line. The \napproximate size of the area is 11,000 square nautical miles. \n\nTransect surveys will cover a minimum of 5% of the SASA.In addition, 10% \nof the total area within the Kitty Hawk, Wilmington East, and Wilmington \nWest Wind Energy Areas –as well as the South Carolina–Grand Stand Call \nArea will be surveyed.\n\nThe planned image resolution of all the imagery for the project will be 1.5-\ncm ground sampling distance at the surface of the ocean.\n\nOption Year 2 includes four surveys of each these areas from May 2019 to \nFeb 2020.\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2022-06-07] The following recorded species names got their assigned scientific names corrected.\nBLACK SCOTER: Melanitta nigra americana =&gt; Melanitta nigra\nGREAT SHEARWATER: Aythya marila =&gt; Puffinus gravis\nGREAT SKUA: Puffinus gravis =&gt; Stercorarius skua\nGREATER SCAUP: Stercorarius skua =&gt; Aythya marila\n\nThe areas defined for survey were the South Atlantic Survey Area (SASA), \nKitty Hawk (KH) Wind Energy Area (WEA), Wilmington East (WE) WEA, \nWilmington West (WW) WEA, Grand Stand Call Area (GSCA), Charleston Call \nArea (CCA), and fish spawning areas SMZ 51 (A51) and SMZ 53 (A53). SASA \nsurveys are linear transects flown in a saw tooth pattern out to the -30-m \ncontour line along the entire South Carolina and North Carolina coasts. \nThese surveys included the CCA, A51 and A53 areas. The overlap portion of \nSASA and CCA is designated “SASA,CCA”; the overlap portion of SASA and \nA51 is designated “SASA,A51”; and the overlap portion of SASA and A53 is \ndesignated “SASA,A53”.The WEAs and GSCA areas are grid surveys through \nthe area plus a 1NM buffer. \n\nGSCA and WW share survey overlap and that overlap portion is designated \nas “GSCA,WW”.The SASA survey area overlaps portions of CCA, A51 and A53 \nareas and overlapped areas are designated by the area name “SASA,CCA”; \n“SASA,A51”; or “SASA,A53”. GSCA and WW also share survey overlap and \nthat area is designated by “GSCA,WW”.DISCLAIMERStudy concept, \noversight, and funding were provided by the US Department of the Interior, \nBureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), Environmental Studies \nProgram, Washington, DC, under Contract Number M17PC00010; Order \nM17PD00063.

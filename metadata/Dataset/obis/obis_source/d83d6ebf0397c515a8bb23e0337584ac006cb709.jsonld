    "description": "Original provider:\nMare Nostrum\n\nDataset credits:\nMare Nostrum NGO, National Institute for Marine Research and Development \"Grigore Antipa\"\n\nAbstract:\nIn the Black Sea, the cetaceans are represented by three species: <i>Phocoena phocoena relicta</i>, <i>Tursiops truncatus ponticus</i> and <i>Delphinus delphis ponticus</i>. The main threat and cause of decline for the Black Sea dolphins are the fishing nets, or bycatches. For the protection of dolphin populations from the Romanian Black Sea area, in conformity with the objectives of the \"National Action Plan for Conservation of Dolphins\" and the \"Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans of the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and contiguous Atlantic Area,\" and with financial support from the European Union through the Sectorial Operational Programme – Environment, NGO \"Mare Nostrum\" started a series of activities in partnership with the National Institute for Marine Research and Development \"Grigore Antipa\" Constanța, Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve Authority, National Agency for Fishing and Aquaculture, Natural Science Museum Complex \"Dolphinarium\" Constanța, Border Police Inspectorate of Constanța County.  The present database presents the situation of dolphin bycatch events at the Romanian coast during 2010 and 2011. The data were collected from the entire Romanian coast, from Sulina to Vama Veche.\n\nPurpose:\nThe purpose of this research was to monitor the population of Black Sea dolphins at the Romanian coast.",

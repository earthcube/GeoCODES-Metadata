Qantas-Link donate the flights to return the turtles back to Cape York when recovered.  Great adventures reef cruises: donate free trips to Green island for turtle releases for the turtles and the volunteers at the rehabilitation centre. Sunlover cruises donate trips to the reef for research and Fitzroy Island for releases. \n\n\nAbstract:\nThe purpose of this project is to assess the success of marine turtles once released back into to the marine environment after undergoing lengthy rehabilitation programs. Many of these turtles have been in rehabilitation for over 19 months previously found in the waters of the Great Barrier Reef suffering from floaters disease  or suffering horrendous injuries from entanglement in discarded 'ghost nets' that were found by Napranum shire council rangers at Pennefather Beach, Cape York Penninsula. Previously when the turtles were released their fate was unknown, now with the assistance of satellite tracking invaluable data can be retrieved regarding the success of the rehabilitation. This is a collaborative project between James Cook University, Cairns turtle rehabilitation centre, Marlin Coast Vet Hospital  and Ian Bell at DERM.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=501\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

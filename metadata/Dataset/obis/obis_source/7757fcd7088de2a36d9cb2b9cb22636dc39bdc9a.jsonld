The Gabon Turtle Partnership receives funding from the Marine Turtle Conservation Fund (US Fish and Wildlife Service, US Department of the Interior).\n\n\nAbstract:\nSince 2005, a partnership of <a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/mtrg/\">conservation biologists</a> and Non-Governmental Organisations, lead by the <a href=\"http://www.ex.ac.uk\">University of Exeter</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org\">Seaturtle.org</a>, <a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/groups/gabon/home.html\">The Gabon Turtle Partnership</a>, Parcs Gabon and the <a href=\"http://www.wcs.org\">Wildlife Conservation Society</a> have been fitting satellite transmitters to <a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/6494/0\">leatherback turtles</a> (<i>Dermochelys coriacea</i>) nesting in <a href=\"http://www.wcs.org/where-we-work/africa/gabon.aspx\">Gabon</a> (Atlantic Coast, Central Africa), whose beaches host the worlds largest nesting aggregation of leatherback turtles, see <a href=\"http://www.wcs.org/new-and-noteworthy/turtle-trove-in-gabon.aspx\">link</a>.This year's fieldwork is taking place in Pongara National Park, northwest Gabon, where the parternship has fitted 2 leatherback turtles with <a href=\"http://www.wildlifecomputers.com/\">satellite tracking</a> devices. The two turtles have been named <a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/cgi-bin/imagelib/index.pl?photo=4797\"> Darwinia</a>, after the projects funders (<a href=\"http://darwin.defra.gov.uk/\">Darwin Initiative</a>), and <a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/cgi-bin/imagelib/index.pl?photo=4798\"> Noelle</a> after the Christmas period. Threats faced by leatherback turtles on the nesting beaches, in the coastal zone and in the open-sea are numerous; satellite tracking enables us to build an understanding of their critical habitats, with the hope to inform plans to limit negative interactions with human activities.This years fieldwork follows the successes of last year, where females were tracked using Argos-linked GPS telemetry, see the <a href=\"http://www.wildlifetracking.org/index.shtml?project_id=340\"> project page</a>. In previous nesting <a href=\"http://www.wildlifetracking.org/index.shtml?project_id=104\">seasons</a> we have attached satellite transmitters to leatherback turtles nesting in <a href=\"http://mayumbanationalpark.com/welcome.htm\"> Mayumba National Park</a>, in the southwest of Gabon.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=466\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

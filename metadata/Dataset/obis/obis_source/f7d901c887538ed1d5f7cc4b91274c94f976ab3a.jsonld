    "description": "Original provider:\nThe Dolphin Project, Inc.\n\nDataset credits:\nThe Dolphin Project, Inc.\n\nAbstract:\nThe Dolphin Project, Inc. conducts quarterly abundance surveys along Georgia estuarine waters to obtain the relative number of dolphins. Also, Photo ID surveys are conducted from January through November to track previously identified dolphin and catalog new individuals..\n\nThe dataset includes data of sightings of Atlantic bottlenose dolphin primarily in Georgia estuarine waters from 1992 to 2003.\n\nPurpose:\nThe Dolphin Project seeks to contribute to the understanding of marine mammals, expand the public's knowledge and concern for our marine environment, and add to the knowledge base of  bottlenose dolphins through the sharing of collected field data.\n\nSupplemental information:\nSurvey effort data, which are points data not lines, are available. Please contact the data provider (contact person) about how to use the effort data.\nUpon permission from the data provider, OBIS-SEAMAP will release the effort data to the user.",

    "description": "Original provider:\nDr Belinda Cannell, Murdoch University\n\nDataset credits:\nData provider\nMurdoch University - Biological Sciences and Biotechnology\nOriginating data center\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/\">Satellite Tracking and Analysis Tool (STAT)</a>\nProject partner\nMurdoch UniversityUniversity of NSW\nProject sponsor or sponsor description\nThis project has been funded under the Australian Research Council Linkage Project Scheme. Funds have also been contributed by Department of Environment and Conservation,Fremantle Ports, Department of Defence, Tiwest and the Winifred Violet Scott Trust fund.\n\n\nAbstract:\nLittle Penguins from Penguin and Garden islands in Perth, Western Australia, are tracked to determine the areas in which they travel and feed throughout the breeding season. Once  the areas they regularly use are determined, the threats the penguins are exposed to, and their likelihood of occurrence, can be elucidated. This forms part of a broader project to determine the population viability analysis of the Little Penguins in the Perth metropolitan region.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=219\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

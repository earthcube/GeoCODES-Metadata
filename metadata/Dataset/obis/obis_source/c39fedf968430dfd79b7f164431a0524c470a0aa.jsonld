    "description": "Original provider:\nHDR Environmental, Operations and Construction, Inc.\n\nDataset credits:\nThe U.S. Navy Marine Species Monitoring Program\n\nAbstract:\nVessel-based marine species monitoring occurred during 5 through 10 December 2011 for an\nAirborne Mine Neutralization System (AMNS) live-inert explosives research, development, test,\nand evaluation (RDT&amp;E) event. These surveys were conducted off the west coast of Florida in\nthe Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) Study Area in the Gulf\nof Mexico (GOM). The AMNS is a mine countermeasures device that includes an explosive\ncharge.\n\nPurpose:\nProtected marine species monitoring during U.S. Navy explosives testing\n\nSupplemental information:\nReferences will be available when they are ready.\nAll the US Navy-funded survey datasets are found in the <a href=\"http://seamap.env.duke.edu/partner/NAVY\">OBIS-SEAMAP US Navy</a> page.",

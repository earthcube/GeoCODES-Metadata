    "description": "Original provider:\nConnie Merigo, New England Aquarium, Boston, MA USA\n\nDataset credits:\nData provider\nNew England Aquarium\nOriginating data center\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/\">Satellite Tracking and Analysis Tool (STAT)</a>\n\n\nAbstract:\nThis juvenile male harbor porpoise known as “Oscar,” stranded on Skaket Beach in Orleans, Massachusetts, on February 17, 2008.  He was rescued by the Cape Cod Stranding Network, A Project of the International Fund for Animal Welfare, and transported to the New England Aquarium for rehabilitation.  Oscar was weak and thin, weighing only 20 kilograms upon arrival, and had a 5cm laceration on his left tail stock.  Diagnostic testing revealed small numbers of intestinal parasites and a mild infection. Oscar was treated with antibiotics and anti-parasite drugs.  Shortly after admitting him to our animal hospital, he developed a cough and moderate to severe dermatitis (a skin infection).  Treatment continued with antibiotic and antifungal medications, until the infection gradually resolved.  Oscar gained 7 kilograms and a great deal of strength during his treatment.  He was released on May 21, 2008 in Massachusetts Bay.The New England Aquarium (NEAq) is a non-profit organization that responds to stranded whales, dolphins, porpoises, seals and sea turtles.  NEAq maintains a rehabilitation hospital for sick or injured marine mammals and sea turtles. Our mission is to provide rapid response and humane care to stranded marine mammals and sea turtles, to conduct research and education and to promote conservation.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=293\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

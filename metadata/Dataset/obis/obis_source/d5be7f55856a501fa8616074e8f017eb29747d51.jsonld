    "description": "This dataset contains occurrences from a paper by J.L. Barnard (1965) on marine Amphipoda from selected atolls in Micronesia, Pacific Ocean. \nTwo large collections of intertidal and sublittoral Amphipoda were made on several atolls of Micronesia, one containing material collected by Dr. D. P. Abbott of Stanford University and Dr. F. M. Bayer of the Smithsonian Institution on Ifaluk Atoll, and by Dr. Cadet Hand of the University of California on Kapingamarangi Atoll, and the other by Dr. D. J. Reish of Long Beach State College, California, on Eniwetok, Majuro, and Bikini atolls. The Abbott-Bayer-Hand collection was made available to the author by Dr. Fenner A. Chace, Jr. of the U.S. National Museum, and a small grant was provided' from the National Research Council for initial sorting of the specimens. The collections of Dr. Reish were made possible by help from the Atomic Energy Commission. All specimens have been deposited in the U.S. National Museum.",

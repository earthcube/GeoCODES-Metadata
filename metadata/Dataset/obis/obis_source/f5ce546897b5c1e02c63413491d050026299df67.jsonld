    "description": "These distribution records were collected as part of a university PhD thesis project designed to investigate the relation between production and standing crop of phytoplankton. Samples were collected in 1966 and 1967 as part of the Marine Ecology Laboratory multidisciplinary program designed to study biological and physical processes pertinent to the marine food web in St. Margaret’s Bay, Nova Scotia. \n\nThis OBIS resource contains a subset of the information contained in the thesis (Saifullah 1969). At this time only the list of species recorded during this study has been republished to create phytoplankton taxa presence information for this area. Please consult the source document and other references for more detailed information.",

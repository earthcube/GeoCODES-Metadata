    "description": "Original provider:\nGreen Heritage Fund of Suriname\n\nDataset credits:\nMonique Pool, Green Heritage Fund of Suriname\n\nAbstract:\nThe Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) project in Suriname was initiated in 2017. Part of this EU-funded project focussed on collecting all the information regarding marine megafauna within the region (Suriname and Guyana). As part of the MSP project we searched for potential marine megafauna data holders and different data-sets were found: \n(1) research data: published and unpublished data collected during dedicated (effort-related) marine fauna surveys (where a GPS track was available); \n(2) data collected by Marine Fauna Observers during geophysical seismic surveys (without an available GPS track); \n(3) Opportunistic data collected without keeping track of effort (e.g. website, social media and other sighting records collected by university students or citizens); and \n(4) Systematic land-based observations carried out during sea turtle surveys on Braamspunt. Here you can find all opportunistic records of marine megafauna in Suriname, including coastal and offshore regions. For the MSP-project we used records which were classed as 'Definite' or 'Probable'. Where 'Definite' records were accompanied by photo; and 'Probable' records had a good description and were coming from a trusted source. Other records with \nan unsure identification (for example  'possible green turtle'), were upgraded to 'Probable' records of species-groups, e.g. 'hard-shelled turtle', 'ray species', 'shark species', 'dolphin sp'. All other records were discarded. NB all bird records submitted by the holders of the \ndatabase 'Birds of Suriname' were classed as 'Definite'.\n\nPurpose:\nThe project aims to significantly enhance the governance and protection of marine and coastal resources of Guyana and Suriname through collaborative processes with all ocean stakeholders, improved knowledge of the coastal and marine environment, enhanced capacity of key stakeholders and informed marine spatial management. Upon completion of the marine Spatial planning project, we aim to continue to add new marine megafauna records to OBIS SEAMAP.\n\nSupplemental information:\nAccuracy of time varies record by record. '00:00' or '12:00' indicates the time is not available.",

    "description": "This dataset is from a paper from Hobson, Mautin and Reese (1961) about two shark incidents at Enewetok Atoll, Marshall Islands.\nThe two shark incidents described in this paper can be considered as unprovoked shark attacks. The importance of documenting these incidents is that they were observed by persons with some experience in the study of animal behaviour. The great need of precise and detailed observational information on shark attacks has been stressed in reports on the subject.",

    "description": "This dataset is from a paper by Dora P. Henry (1957) about some littoral barnacles from the Tuamotu, Marshall and Caroline Islands.\nA small number of barnacles collected by the Pacific Science Board expeditions at three localities - Ngarumaoa, Tuamotu Islands; South Loi Island, Marshall Islands; and Ifaluk Atoll, Caroline Islands - was sent to the author for identification. In all, there are seven species: three from the Caroline Islands, one from the Marshall Islands, and four, including one new species, from the Tuamotu Islands. In addition, a few barnacles collected by the Albatross at Makemo, Tuamotu Islands, were borrowed from the U.S. National Museum (USNM) to compare with the new material.",

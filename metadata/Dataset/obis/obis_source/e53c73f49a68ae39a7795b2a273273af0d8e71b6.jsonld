    "description": "Original provider:\nPRBO Conservation Science\n\nDataset credits:\nThe projects were conducted under the grants awarded to the following \norganizations and their scientists.\n\nThe principle investigators of the CalCOFI part of this dataset are\n(in the chronological order from 1987 to 2006):\nRichard Veit and John McGowan, Scripps Institution of Oceanography (1987-1994)\nDavid Hyrenbach, Scripps Institution of Oceanography (1994-2000)\nBill Sydeman, PRBO Conservation Science (2000-2006)\n\nThe principle investigators of the Rockfish part of this dataset is\nBill Sydeman, PRBO Conservation Science (1996-2006)\n\n# the affiliations are the ones they belonged to at the time of the surveys.\n\nThe data were contributed by PRBO Conservation Science.\nThese two projects are on going. See [Supplemental information] for the \ninformation on the PIs and organizations in recent years.\n\nAbstract:\nThis dataset contains observation data of marine birds and mammals from California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) from 1987-2006 and Rockfish cruises along the California coast from 1996-2006 by National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS).\n\nData were collected aboard research vessels using standardized marine bird and mammal survey techniques (Tasker et al. 1984, Buckland et al. 1993). Marine birds \nand mammals were observed in a 90-degree arc from the bow to one side of the ship out to 300m. Counts are summarized by species and behavior along the transects in 3 km bins. Data span years 1987 - 2006.\n\nPurpose:\nRelating changing ocean productivity patterns and upper-trophic predator (seabirds and marine mammals) distributions to the underlying physical oceanographic variability enhances our understanding of the ecological context of the CalCOFI and NMFS database, thereby aiding in the interpretation of large-scale hydrographic and ocean productivity patterns.  An inter-disciplinary, ecosystem-level perspective will provide new insight into offshore California wildlife habitat associations and how apex marine organisms (including fish with diets similar to seabirds and/or mammals) respond to differences in ocean climate, productivity, and water mass properties, information needed to manage fisheries and wildlife under changing ocean conditions.\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2020-09-30] The following invalid species names were corrected according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS).\nBlack-footed Albatross: Diomedea nigripes (174516) =&gt; Phoebastria nigripes (554379)\nBonaparte's Gull: Larus philadelphia (176839) =&gt; Chroicocephalus philadelphia (824040)\nCaspian Tern: Sterna caspia (176924) =&gt; Hydroprogne caspia (176935)\nElegant Tern: Sterna elegans (176925) =&gt; Thalasseus elegans (176931)\nFranklin's Gull: Larus pipixcan (176838) =&gt; Leucophaeus pipixcan (824082)\nGreat Egret: Casmerodius albus (174810) =&gt; Ardea alba (554135)\nLaughing Gull: Larus atricilla (176837) =&gt; Leucophaeus atricilla (824079)\nLaysan Albatross: Diomedea immutabilis (174517) =&gt; Phoebastria immutabilis (554378)\nLeast Tern: Sterna antillarum (176923) =&gt; Sternula antillarum (824127)\nRed Phalarope: Phalaropus fulicaria (554376) =&gt; Phalaropus fulicarius (176734)\nRoyal Tern: Sterna maxima (176922) =&gt; Thalasseus maximus (824142)\nSouth Polar Skua: Catharacta maccormicki (176801) =&gt; Stercorarius maccormicki (660062)\nWillet: Catoptrophorus semipalmatus (176638) =&gt; Tringa semipalmata (824147)\nParula americana (178868) =&gt; Setophaga americana (950033)\nDendroica petechia T(178878) =&gt; Setophaga petechia (950039)\nDendroica townsendi (178897) =&gt; Setophaga townsendi (950058)\nDendroica occidentalis (178902) =&gt; Setophaga occidentalis (950059)\nDendroica coronata (178891) =&gt; Setophaga coronata (950046)\nWilsonia pusilla (178973) =&gt; Cardellina pusilla (950080)\n\n[UPDATE 2013-03-25] The following species codes had been associated with invalid species names.

The location is represented at \nthe middle of the bin. Length may be less at the end of a transect, and width \nmay be less depending on the weather.\nEach bin is temporally about 10 minutes in duration (depending on ship speed).\n\nTracklines on this map represent on-effort only. Off-effort tracks may be obtained \nfrom the data provider.",

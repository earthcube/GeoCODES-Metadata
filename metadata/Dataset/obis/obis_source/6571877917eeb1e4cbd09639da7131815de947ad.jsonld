    "description": "A list of Hawaiian fish species was created from contemporary and historical documents dating back to 1758. For each species, the name of the person who described and first named the species (according to The International Code of Zoological Nomenclature) along with the date of the description, the family, the status (indigenous, etc.), the range along the Hawaiian archipelago for the sightings, and miscellaneous notes are given. Observations were taken within the 200 nmi Hawaiian Exclusive Economic Zone. The list was taken from \"A Checklist of the Fishes of the Hawaiian Archipelago\" by B. Mundy, in press, B. P. Bishop Museum Bulletin of Zoology, Bishop Museum Press.",

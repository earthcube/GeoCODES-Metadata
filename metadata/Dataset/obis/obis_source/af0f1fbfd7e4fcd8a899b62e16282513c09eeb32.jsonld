    "name": "Year-round at-sea movements of fairy prions (Pachyptila turtur)  from Kanowna Island, Bass Strait, south-eastern Australia (2017-2020)",
    "description": "The study was conducted at Kanowna Island (39°150 S, 146°300 E) in northern Bass Strait, southeastern Australia during the incubation and chick-rearing periods of breeding (October–January) over 4 consecutive years (2017–2021) in order to evaluate the at-sea movements of fairy prions during breeding.  There are 73 trips from adult breeding birds (N individuals = 14 and n trips = 15 in incubation; N individuals = 31 and n trips = 58 in chick-rearing). Each was equipped with a miniaturized GPS logger.\nGeolocator data was also acquired but not presented here as the location errors are not known. Data was sourced from the linked repository (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.5994501 ) in the cited paper on 2022-07-10.",

    "description": "As part of the Caribbean Coral Reef Ecosystems Program, thirty-nine qualitative collections were made in the mangrove islands at Twin Cays, Belize between 29 January and 22 February 1987. Most collections were made by examining intertidal and subtidal substrates along the shoreline of Twin Cays while snorkeling. This resource contains percentage frequencies of occurrence of hydroid taxa in the qualitative collections.",

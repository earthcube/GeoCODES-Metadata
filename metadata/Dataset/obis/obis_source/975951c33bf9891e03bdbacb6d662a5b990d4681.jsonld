    "description": "Collection of fish captured in research projects carried out by the UFES Ichthyology and Ichthyoplankton Laboratory, together with the fish collection from the UFES Zoology Collection. It serves as a reference collection and is intended for consultation by general researchers to confirm species identification. The relevance of the collection lies in the fact that most of the material comes from places that have not yet been studied or have little information and research. These data are mobilized from <a href=\"https://specieslink.net/col/CIUFES/\">speciesLink</a>. Data downloaded 2023-10-23.",

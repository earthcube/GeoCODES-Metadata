    "description": "Original provider:\nFondazione Cetacea\n\nDataset credits:\nData provider\nIslameta Group, Dept. of Biology - University of Pisa\nOriginating data center\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/\">Satellite Tracking and Analysis Tool (STAT)</a>\n\n\nAbstract:\nThe ADRIA-Watch project (www.adriawatch.provincia.rimini.it)is a scientific observatory for large marine vertebrates of the Northern Adriatic Sea. Data are collected and pooled together into one single database, working towards a better understanding and dealing of the problems affecting the large inhabitants of the area and to promote public awareness. ADRIA-Watch collects data on sightings and strandings of Cetaceans (dolphins and whales), marine turtles and sharks along our coasts.ADRIA-Watch also contributes to a sharing of knowledge:  web site, public conferences, scientific seminars, didactic material and educational projects.In the framework of this project 5 satellite-tracked loggerhead turtles will be released in 2006, from five different sites in the northern Adriatic sea, from both Eastern (Slovenian and Croatian) and Western (Italian) shores.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=161\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

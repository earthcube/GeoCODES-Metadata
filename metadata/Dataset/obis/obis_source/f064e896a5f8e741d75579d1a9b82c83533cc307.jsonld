    "name": "GPS tracking and dive data from 84 foraging trip tracks of Little Penguins (32 female, 31 male) , Port Campbell, Victoria, Australia (2012-2013)",
    "description": "The study was conducted at the London Bridge breeding colony (38°37′19″S, 142°55′57″E), south-eastern Australia, during the chick-rearing period in 2011/12 and 2012/13. This small mainland colony hosted 68 and 70 active nests in the first and second study periods, respectively. Chick-rearing lasts for 8–10 weeks and consists of two stages: guard stage (2 weeks) where adults make one-day foraging trips while the partner tends to the chicks; and post guard stage (6 to 8 weeks) where adults leave chicks unattended to forage at sea [19]. Breeding adults were instrumented with a GPS data logger (IgotU120, Mobile Action Technology, 44.5×28.5×13 mm), packaged in heat-shrink tubing, programmed to sample location (±10 m) every 2 min. In addition, individuals were deployed with a time-depth recorder (TDR LAT1500, Lotek Wireless Inc, 35×8×8 mm) to measure depth (±0.01 m) every 4 s\nData has been reduced to 5 minute GPS locations if on the surface (depth &lt; 0.5 metre) whilst full dive data has been retained.

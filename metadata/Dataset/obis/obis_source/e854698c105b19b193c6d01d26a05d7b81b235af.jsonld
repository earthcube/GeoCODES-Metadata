    "description": "Original provider:\nTGS\n\nDataset credits:\nASRC Energy Services, Inc.\nTGS-NOPEC Geophysical Company\nRPS\n\nAbstract:\nTGS-NOPEC Geophysical Company (TGS) conducted a 2D marine seismic survey along predetermined lines in U.S. Federal and international waters of the Chukchi Sea during the open-water season from 25 August to 30 October 2013. Two vessels were involved including 1) a seismic vessel (Geo Arctic) towing a 3,280 cu.in. seismic array and 8,100 m long solid streamer cable and 2) a marine mammal monitoring vessel (Norseman) which operated in advance of the seismic vessel.  Both vessels had teams of visual protected species observers (PSOs) trained to monitor and implement seismic mitigation according to regulatory permits from U.S. Agencies. Twenty-six detections were made over 1195.5 hours of acoustic monitoring. In addition to acoustic monitoring, the monitoring vessel also employed visual protected species observers (PSOs). This data set includes acoustic detection data and visual sighting data is presented separately.\n\nPurpose:\nN/A\n\nSupplemental information:\nIn numeric fields, original data may contain 'X' which was replaced with Null.",

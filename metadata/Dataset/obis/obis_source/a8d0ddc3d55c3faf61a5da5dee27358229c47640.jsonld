    "description": "Original provider:\nTGS\n\nDataset credits:\nASRC Energy Services, Inc.\nTGS-NOPEC Geophysical Company\n\nAbstract:\nTGS-NOPEC Geophysical Company (TGS) conducted a 2D marine seismic survey along predetermined lines in U.S. Federal and international waters of the Chukchi Sea during the open-water season from 25 August to 30 October 2013. Two vessels were involved including 1) a seismic vessel (Geo Arctic) towing a 3,280 cu.in. seismic array and 8,100 m long solid streamer cable and 2) a marine mammal monitoring vessel (Norseman) which operated in advance of the seismic vessel.  Both vessels had teams of visual protected species observers (PSOs) trained to monitor and implement seismic mitigation according to regulatory permits from U.S. Agencies.  A combined-vessel total of 480 visual sightings occurred over 30,798  km of combined-vessel observer effort (both on and off effort). In addition to visual observers, the monitoring vessel also employed a towed passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) system. This dataset includes visual sighting data and acoustic data is presented separately.\n\nSupplemental information:\nIn numeric or date/time fields, original data may contain 'X' which was replaced with Null.",

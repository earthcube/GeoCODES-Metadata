    "description": "Spatial variability in community structure of dictyoceratid sponges (Class Demospongiae; Order Dictyoceratida) was examined on coral reefs in Torres Strait, an archipelago of islands and reefs between northern Queensland, Australia, and Papua New Guinea. Dictyoceratid sponge abundances and environmental parameters were recorded at 4 locations, separated by 50-220 km. Each location was subdivided into 5-7 sites, each 2 km apart. At each site four 50x2 m belt transects were quantitatively surveyed, recording dictyoceratid numbers, substrate type (rock, rubble and sand), water clarity, degree of reef slope and depth. Dictyoceratid abundance was similar among locations, averaging 15.5 individuals per 100 m2, but varied significantly among sites. Twenty three dictyoceratid species were recorded in Torres Strait, with approximately half (12/23) found in only one location.\nSurvey dates from 28-Nov-2004 To 19-Dec-2005 have not been recorded against individual observations so have been set to 2005-01-01.",

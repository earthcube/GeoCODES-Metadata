    "description": "<p>This dataset provides access to seabird sighting records collected throughout the historical series of PELACUS surveys, from 2007 to 2022.</p><p>The PELACUS survey is an annual survey for the evaluation of fishing resources organized by the Spanish Institute of Oceanography (IEO-CSIC) that has incorporated top predators’ (marine mammals, birds and turtles) observers since 2007. The spatial coverage of this survey covers the continental shelf waters in the north and northwest of the Iberian Peninsula, comprising Spanish waters found between the coast and the 1000 meters isobath, from the northern border with Portugal, at the mouth of the Miño River, to the border with France in the Bay of Biscay. This survey has carried out additional transects in some of its editions, sampling on the continental shelf of northern Portugal, as well as the French slope in the Bay of Biscay. Data on sightings in these areas are included.</p>",

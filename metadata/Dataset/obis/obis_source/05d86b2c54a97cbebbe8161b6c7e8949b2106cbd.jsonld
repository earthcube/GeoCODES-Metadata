    "description": "Original provider:\nBureau of Ocean Energy Management\n\nDataset credits:\nTexas A&amp;M University\nOregon State University\nScripps Institution of Oceanography\nTexas A&amp;M University-Galveston\nUniversity of Colorado\nUniversity of Durham\nUniversity of Saint Andrews\nUniversity of South Florida\nWoods Hole Oceanographic Institution\n\nAbstract:\nSperm Whale Seismic Study (SWSS) was a multi-institutional, interdisciplinary research project supported by the then Minerals Management Service (MMS; now Bureau of Ocean Energy Management - BOEM) under Cooperative Agreement 1435-01-02-CA-85186 for Cooperative Research on Sperm Whales and their Response to Seismic Exploration in the Gulf of Mexico through the Texas A&amp;M Research \n\nFoundation.The objectives of SWSS were to\n(1) establish baseline information on the biology and behavior of sperm whales in the northern Gulf of Mexico,\n(2) characterize sperm whale habitat use in the northern Gulf of Mexico, and\n(3) determine possible changes in behavior of sperm whales when subjected to manmade noise, particularly from seismic airgun arrays used for offshore oil and gas exploration and geological monitoring.\n\nSupplemental information:\nThis dataset includes sightings of cetaceans other than sperm whales in 2002-2004. Sperm whale visual tracking data are found in <a href=\"/dataset/904\">BOEM Sperm Whale Seismic Study (SWSS) S-Tag sperm whale trackings 2002-2004</a> which is also accompanied with effort data.\n\nSince the 2005 data are in a different format, they are registered separately as <a href=\"/dataset/905\">BOEM Sperm Whale Seismic Study (SWSS) S-Tag cetacean sightings 2005</a>",

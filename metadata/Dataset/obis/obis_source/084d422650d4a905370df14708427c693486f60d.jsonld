    "description": "Original provider:\nGVI Mexico\n\nDataset credits:\nLluvia Soto\n\nAbstract:\nGVI working in partnership with Amigos de Sian Kaan (ASK), have been monitoring Mexico’s Caribbean reefs since 2003. Data are collected at Pez Maya (20.00222 degrees N, 87.28624 degrees W) and Punta Gruesa (19.00865 degrees N, 87.58977 degrees W) to support the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System project and provide information to the National Parks Commission (CONANP). These data are now being used by GVI and its partners to promote the management of the reserve’s resources in a more sustainable manner.\n\nPurpose:\nThe objective of this monitoring program is the creation of a database that will help to assess the health of the Mexican-Caribbean reefs.\n\nWe dive regularly and all incidences of target species are recorded and the global positioning system (GPS) coordinates are known from our monitoring program.\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2020-09-30] The following invalid species names were corrected according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS).\nTurtles: Testudines (173749) =&gt; Testudines (948936)\n\n[UPDATE] 2017 Jan - Mar data were added on 2017-04-10.\n[UPDATE] 2016 Jul - Dec data were added on 2016-12-14.\n[UPDATE] Coordinates for some sites were corrected on 2016-09-14 affecting more than 500 records.\n[UPDATE] 2016 Jan - Jun data were added on 2016-07-15.\n[UPDATE] 2015 Jan - Jun data were added on 2015-06-30.\n[UPDATE] 2014 Jul - Dec data were added on 2015-01-12.\n[UPDATE] 2014 Jan - Jun data were added on 2014-07-09.\n[UPDATE] 2012 and 2013 data were added on 2014-02-07.",

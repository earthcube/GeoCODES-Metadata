    "description": "Original provider:\nInstitute for Marine Mammal Studies\n\nDataset credits:\nData provider\nInstitute for Marine Mammal Studies\nOriginating data center\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/\">Satellite Tracking and Analysis Tool (STAT)</a>\n\n\nAbstract:\nTurtles are an important part of the ecosystem, and may serve as a good biological indicator of the health of the environment they inhabit. They are constantly impacted by a variety of both natural and anthropogenic factors.Satellite telemetry is a powerful tool for examining long-term movements of these protected species, and enhancing conservation and management efforts. These observations will allow us to see how much time these turtles actually spend in the Mississippi sound, prior to moving on. The use of satellite tags on recently rehabilitated and released Kempâ€™s ridley sea turtles will increase our knowledge about the daily activities and habitat delineation of these animals.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=678\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

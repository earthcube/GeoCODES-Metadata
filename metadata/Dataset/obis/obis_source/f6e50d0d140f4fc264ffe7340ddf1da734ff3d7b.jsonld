    "description": "This dataset maps fishing locations of American eels on the east coast of Canada, derived from logbook records, interviews with fisheries officers, and data collected by government agencies. Fishing locations indicate presence of eels because fishers would not fish at these locations if eels were absence.  However, absence of records does not indicate absence of eels.  There may be no eel fishery in a given area for several reasons, including regulatory prohibitions, lack of markets, and lack of a local eel fishing tradition.",

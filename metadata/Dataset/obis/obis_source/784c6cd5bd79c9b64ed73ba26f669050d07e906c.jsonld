    "description": "Original provider:\nNOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC)\n\nDataset credits:\nNOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC)\n\nAbstract:\nThe ship survey was conducted from 06 August 1995 to 05 September 1995, beginning and ending in Woods Hole, MA. The study area covered approximately 12,600 nmi2 , and included the area bounded by Portland, ME to St. John, New\nBrunswick, to the southern tip of Nova Scotia.\n\nThis cruise was part of a large scale marine mammal sighting survey which consisted of two legs (each approximately a month long) on each of two ships, and a six week aerial survey which was conducted concurrently with vessel operations. The entire study area was from Chesapeake Bay, VA, USA to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada.\n\nPurpose:\nThe objectives of this survey were to:\n1) Estimate the abundance of harbor porpoises in the Gulf of Maine - Bay of Fundy - Scotian shelf area using two different field collection and analysis methods.\n2) Determine the spatial distribution and estimate the abundance of other cetaceans found in the above area.\n3) Conduct a comparison between sighting rates and spatial distribution of harbor porpoises as seen by two different types of sighting platforms, a ship (the R/V ABEL-J) and an aircraft.\n4) Determine spatial distribution patterns of harbor porpoises, and investigate if the patterns are correlated with hydrographic or biological features, such as, water depth, temperature or salinity.\n5) Determine if harbor porpoises avoid this ship, and if so, at what distance.\n6) Compare the abundance estimate and spatial distribution of harbor porpoises as seen this year with that seen in previous years.\n\nSupplemental information:\nIn addition to the sighting data, effort data was recorded  every half hour or whenever conditions change.\nThis dataset, therefore, should be used with the effort data.\n\nPart I was conducted during July 9 - August 2, 1995.",

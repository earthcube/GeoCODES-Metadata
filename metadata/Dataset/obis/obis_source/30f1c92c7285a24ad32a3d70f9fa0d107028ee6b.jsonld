    "description": "Bioblitz survey which took place in Wembury. This survey's aim was to record as many species as possible as being present within a set survey area over 24-hours.  A variety of different methods were employed, incuding times-species searches, plankton netting, Seine-netting, Pond-dipping with nets, mammal trapping, walkovers, push-netting, grab/core, transect/quadrat, and including Dive and snorkel surveys, although most records were ad-hoc sightings made during the 24 hour survey.",

    "description": "This dataset is from a paper by Kellie Pendoley and Margaret Christian (2012) giving a summary of marine turtle records for Norfolk Island, Australia.\nNothing has been published in the modern literature on the status of marine turtles at Norfolk Island although their presence has been recognised since 1793 (Fidlon &amp; Ryan 1980). This study brings together all the available published, anecdotal and field survey data on marine turtles at Norfolk Island so that the status of habitat usage could be established. The results confirm the Norfolk Island group is used for foraging by resident adult and juvenile Chelonia mydas (Green) turtles and adult Eretmochelys imbricata (Hawksbill) turtles. The natal beaches for these resident animals are thought to be Melanesian and Polynesian islands to the north and the beaches of north eastern Australia. While juvenile hawksbill turtles have not been recorded foraging at Norfolk Island they are the most common species and age class recorded in the island's strandings data. The confirmation of marine turtles at Norfolk means that any species proposals must include assessment of project impacts on these under Australian Federal legislation and their marine bioregional processes.",

    "description": "This resource contains a list of marine benthic algae from Iles de la Madeleine, Quebec as published in 1979 (Seve et al). This resource contains species identified by De Seve et al )(1978) and Cardinal (1967a, 1968). These works were previously published in uncirculated reports. \n\nSampling took place in the Iles de la Madeleine archipelago, a group of islands located on the Magdalen Shallows near the centre of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, an inland sea in the Northwest Atlantic. The islands have long sand bars enclosing several lagoons, some of which have channels open to the sea (Tiphane 1976). Benthic samples were collected by divers (De Seve et al 1978) and samples collected by dredges as part of the l’Akpatok expedition in 1966 (Cardinal 1967d, 1968). The location, month and depth of sampling is also recorded.",

    "description": "A checklist of the fishes of New Caledonia is presented. A total of 2328 species in 246 families have been recorded from the region. Eight of these species are not native, but have been introduced. Five fish families are represented only by introduced species. The native fish fauna of New Caledonia therefore consists of 2320 species in 241 families. The largest families are the Gobiidae, Labridae, Pomacentridae, Serranidae, Apogonidae, Blenniidae, Macrouridae, Myctophidae and Muraenidae. The freshwater fish fauna is dominated by the families Gobiidae, Eleotridae, Anguillidae and Mugilidae. A total of 61 species represent new records from New Caledonia.",

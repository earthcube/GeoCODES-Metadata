    "description": "A study that focuses on the seasonal community structure of the macrobenthic molluscs at the marine-lagoonal environmental gradient that takes place at Kalloni solar saltworks (Lesvos Island, NE Aegean Sea, Greece). The molluscan community was studied by means of four seasonal samplings carried out in 2004 at four sites located along the marine-lagoonal environmental gradient in the study area.\nFull citation: Α.

    "description": "Biological data collected on Southern Surveyor cruise SS 02/94. This cruise took place in Tasmanian, Victorian and New South Wales coastal and offshore waters during 17-25 February 1994, under the leadership of Barry Bruce, for an ichthyoplankton survey project. Biological data collected on this cruise include samples of larval fish, demersal and midwater fish, invertebrates, zooplankton and ichthyoplankton. A total of 339 stomachs from 18 species for feeding studies, 120 muscle samples (17 species) for stable isotope analysis and 315 otolith sets (15 species) and 40 vertebrae (2 species) for ageing studies. 25 fish species, including 80 kg of the oreo Neocyttus rhomboidalis from one demersal deepwater trawl. A diverse range of fish specimens for taxonomic analyses. Several benthic sediment samples for analysis of phytoplankton pigments and breakdown products.\nReports, metadata and other data from this voyage are at https://www.marine.csiro.au/data/trawler/survey_details,cfm?survey=SS199402",

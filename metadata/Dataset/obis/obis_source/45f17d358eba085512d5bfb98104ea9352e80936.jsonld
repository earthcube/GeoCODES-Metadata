    "description": "Historic seabird observations around New Zealand coastal waters and the south-western Pacific observed and recorded by Neil Cheshire on a variety of coastal and ocean commercial shipping vessels. Observations typically 2 to 3 times per day for up to 2 hours. Location and weather details (air and sea temperature, cloud cover, wind speed and direction and atmospheric pressure) were recorded at the start period. Original data recording sheets  can be downloaded at https://www.marine.csiro.au/data/trawler/download.cfm?file_id=5321. Data entered by OBIS Australia and where possible matched to WoRMS taxa.",

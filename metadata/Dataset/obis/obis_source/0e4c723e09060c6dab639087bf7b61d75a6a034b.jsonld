    "description": "This is the OBIS extraction of the OTN NS Southern Upland Salmon Tagging project, consisting only of the release tagging metadata. i.e. the locations  and dates of tagged animal release. If readers are  interested in the full source  dataset they should refer to the OTN web site  (members.oceantrack.org). Abstract: To investigate late riverine, estuarine and early marine migration and survival of wild Atlantic salmon smolts/post-smolts, we tagged 35 wild salmon smolts in each of 4 Nova Scotia Southern Upland rivers (Total of 140 smolts). The rivers where fish were tagged (and 64 receivers deployed) were; The LaHave River, The Gold River (Chester), The West River (Sheet Harbour) and The St. Mary's River. 2010 was the first year for all river tagging projects, with the exception of the West River, upon which it was year #3.",

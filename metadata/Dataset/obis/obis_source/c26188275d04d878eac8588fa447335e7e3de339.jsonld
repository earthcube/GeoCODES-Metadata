Our preliminary objective is to produce an estimated inventory of sea turtles using a photo identification monitoring method. This will allow us to better understand turtle population and migration patterns. A major threat these creatures are facing in the country is turtle and egg poaching. For this reason, one aspect of the MSTCP consists of protecting turtle nesting sites and rearing a few individuals per clutch in order to increase their survival rate.Off shore, Olive Ridley Sea Turtles are particularly exposed to Ghost Nets. Another aspect of the MSTCP is to rescue and rehabilitate injured Olive Ridley Sea Turtles and track them after release to study both the success of rehabilitation and the global distribution of the species in the Indian Ocean.\n\nSupplemental information:\n<a href=\"http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking/index.shtml?project_id=750\">Visit STAT's project page</a> for additional information.\n\nThis dataset is a summarized representation of the telemetry locations aggregated per species per 1-degree cell.",

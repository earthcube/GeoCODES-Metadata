    "description": "Original provider:\nUniversity of North Carolina, Wilmington\n\nDataset credits:\nWilliam A. McLellan, University of North Carolina Wilmington\n\nAbstract:\nThe protected species monitoring program, initiated in response to Onslow Bay, North Carolina, United States being identified as a potential site for the United States Navyâ€™s Undersea Warfare Training Range (USWTR), is now into its third year. To estimate marine mammal density, distribution, and seasonality, a multi-platform approach was implemented using traditional visual line transect survey methods from aerial and vessel platforms along with passive acoustic monitoring from vessels and moored instruments. This project represents a long term data set used to assess residency and abundance patterns of this offshore area in the waters off North Carolina.\n\nPurpose:\nTo estimate marine mammal density, distribution, and seasonality, a multi-platform approach was implemented using traditional visual line transect survey methods from aerial and vessel platforms along with passive acoustic monitoring from vessels and moored instruments.\n\nSupplemental information:\n[UPDATE 2012-12-07] The following two sightings were remarked as event 10.0 (opportunistic)\n10/02/09, 9:50:00, bottlenose\n10/02/09, 10:01:00, bottlenose\nThe original survey data are separated into two datasets, from left and right observers.  This dataset is from the left side sightings data.\nThe right side sightings data are available on OBIS-SEAMAP in the <a href=\"http://seamap.env.duke.edu/datasets/detail/588\">USWTR Onslow Bay Aerial Survey -Right side- 2008-2010</a> dataset.\n\nThis dataset includes a subset of the data collection for the Onlsow Aerial surveys.\nOther data of the collection are available in the following datasets:\n<a href=\"http://seamap.env.duke.edu/dataset/751\">USWTR Onslow Bay Aerial Survey -Right side- 2010-2011</a>\n<a href=\"http://seamap.env.duke.edu/dataset/749\">USWTR Onslow Bay Aerial Survey -Left side- 2010-2011</a>\n<a href=\"http://seamap.env.duke.edu/dataset/588\">USWTR Onslow Bay Aerial Survey -Right side- 2008-2010</a>\n<a href=\"http://seamap.env.duke.edu/dataset/435\">UNCW Aerial Surveys for monitoring of proposed Onslow Bay USWTR site - Left side -</a>\n<a href=\"http://seamap.env.duke.edu/dataset/437\">UNCW Aerial Surveys for monitoring of proposed Onslow Bay USWTR site - Right side -</a>\n\nAll the US Navy-funded survey datasets are found in the <a href=\"http://seamap.env.duke.edu/partner/NAVY\">OBIS-SEAMAP US Navy</a> page.",

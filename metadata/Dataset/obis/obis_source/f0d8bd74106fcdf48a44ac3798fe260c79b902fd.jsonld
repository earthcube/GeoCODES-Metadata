    "description": "The objective of Project 5.3 and 5.4 was to determine whether recovery of seagrass in the Pilbara following disturbance is by sexual (recruitment from seeds) or asexual (vegetative regrowth from rhizome extension) means, and the relative importance of each. This dataset contains percent coverage of 6 species of seagrass including absence records.\nData sourced from CSIRO Data Access Portal https://doi.org/10.4225/08/59f7df8e4afc0 on 2020-23-07.

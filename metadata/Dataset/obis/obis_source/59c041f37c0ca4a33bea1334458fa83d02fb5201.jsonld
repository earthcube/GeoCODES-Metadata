    "description": "The Fisheries Logbook System records the fishing and non-fishing activity of fishermen who are required to report their fishing activity via logbooks submitted for each trip. The Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) manages two vessel logbook programs. This program principally covers vessels that use pelagic longline gear, but also includes vessels that use other types of gear (harpoon and handline) that target pelagic species in the highly migratory species fishery management plan. This logbook program was initiated in 1986, and has continued uninterrupted since then. Because the pelagic program supports assessments that require catch per unit effort data for individual sets, the design of this program focuses on data for individual sets.",

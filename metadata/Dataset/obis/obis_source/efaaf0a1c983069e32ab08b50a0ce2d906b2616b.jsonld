    "description": "The macrozoobentos dataset includes a number of 234 samples collected in the East Constanta sector of the Romanian marine waters from five standard stations (Station 1-5) between 14 m to 55m depths. Van Veen grab with a sampling area of 1/20 m2 was employed as a macrozoobenthos sampler. One replicate was collected at every station. Sampling was done in winter, spring, summer and autumn mounths.The samples have been analyzed qualitative (number of species) and quantitative (densities and biomasses). The macroinvertebrates have been identified at species level.",

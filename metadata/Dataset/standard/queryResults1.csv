The tests aimed to investigate inelastic torsional response under uni-directional seismic excitation due to torsional stiffness irregularity (Series-1A) and unsymmetric damage (i.e. Series-1B with Damage Irregularity). In Series-1A, an unreinforced masonry infill wall was installed in one edge (West) of the first story of the structure, which resulted in high drift demand in the flexible East frame. Series-1B tested a system with damage irregularity caused by torsional response in Series-1A. The test data will be valuable to validate numerical analysis for the specimen as well as to improve seismic assessment for existing buildings subjected to inelastic torsional response.  ** *** description should describe whats actually in the dataset... This dataset contains results from the analysis of two specimens including sensor information and the resulting specimen reports, 45 experiment runs, three model configurations, and a project report. Each experiment event is documented by raw and processed csv tabular data [what are the fields in the tables????], video of the experiment, and GM acceleration and displacment data in csv tables.

The Diablo Canyon project study is located in San Luis Obispo County, California, and encompasses approximately 10,634 acres (43.03 square kilometers). Watershed Sciences, Inc. (WSI) collected Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar) data on both the inland and intertidal land within the Diablo Canyon study area on 28 January 2010. For optimal capture of the intertidal zone, WSI acquired Lidar data of the coastline during seasonal low tides (between 0.0 ft and peak low of ~ -1.5 ft) and in conjunction with a PDOP value of less than 3.0.    This Lidar survey utilized a Leica ALS50 Phase II laser system. The sensor scan angle was ±13° from nadir with a pulse rate designed to yield an average native density of ≥8 pulses per square meter over terrestrial surfaces. The area of interest was surveyed with an opposing flight line side-lap of ≥50% (≥100% overlap) to reduce laser shadowing and increase surface laser painting.   This survey was flown as part of the DCPP Long-Term Seismic Program (LTSP). In addition to aerial Lidar data, DEM and orthophotography raster data are available for this area: Diablo Canyon DEMs and Orthophotos.",OpenTopography,,"San Luis Obispo County, Diablo Canyon, California, PG&E, Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP), lidar",,,

Geophysical Research Letters 15: doi: 10.1029/88GL02098. issn: 0094-8276. (Dataset)","Paleomagnetic measurements on asphaltic samples from two formations in southern Oklahoma have been performed. A bioclastic unit from the Boggy Formation, known as the Buckhorn asphalt, exhibited a stable, characteristic remanent moment (RM) after A.F. demagnetization between 5–20 mT. We infer from our data that very fine, possibly authigenic magnetite, like that shown to have a genetic relationship with the migration through rocks of hydrocarbons [Elmore et al., 1987], is the primary RM carrier in these samples. The tilt corrected paleopole for the Buckhorn asphalt (121.9 E; 43.5 N; dp=1.3; dm=2.3) falls on the Early Permian Apparent Polar Wander Path for North America of Irving and Irving [1982], using a 30 Ma window (270–280 Ma). Because the Boggy Formation, containing the Buckhorn asphalt, was deposited during the Late Pennsylvanian (Desmoinesian), we interpret the data to indicate magnetization during minor uplift in the Early Permian of the Arbuckle Mountain region. The RM appears to have been acquired at this time, probably as the result of magnetite production facilitated by the introduction time of sulfate reducing bacteria. © American Geophysical Union 1988",EarthRef.org,,":Geomagnetism and Paleomagnetism, General or miscellaneous:Geomagnetism and Paleomagnetism, Rock and mineral magnetism:Geomagnetism and Paleomagnetism, Paleomagnetism applied to tectonics (regional, global):Information Related to Geologic Time, Paleozoic:Information Related to Geographic Region, North America:",2006-12-19T10:32:02.000Z,,

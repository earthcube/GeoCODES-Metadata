"description": "an information exchange schema, which has been used in water data services within the Hydrologic Information System (HIS) project supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation, and has been adopted by several federal agencies as a format for serving hydrologic data. The goal of the first version of WaterML was to encode the semantics of hydrologic observation discovery and retrieval and implement water data services in a way that is both generic and unambiguous across different data providers, thus creating the least barriers for adoption by the hydrologic research community. This documents WaterML version 1.0 as implemented and utilized in the CUAHSI HIS system. Data sources that can be queried via WaterMLcompliant water data services include many national and international repositories of water data, and a growing number of academic observation networks registered by researchers associated with the hydrologic observatories.",

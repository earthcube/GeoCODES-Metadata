"description": "To allow large variables with more than 4-billion array elements, 64-bit data format is develop to support such I/O requests. Files with the 64-bit data are identified with a 'CDF\\005' (note the first '\\' is an escape character for JSON encoding) at the beginning of the file. Since CDF-5 format was introduced in version 4.4.0, earlier versions of the netCDF library can't read CDF-5 files. In order to allow defining large array variables with more than 4-billion elements, CDF-5 replaces most of the 32-bit integers used to describe metadata with 64-bit integers. In addition, it supports the following new external data types: NC_UBYTE, NC_USHORT, NC_UINT, NC_INT64, and NC_UINT64.",

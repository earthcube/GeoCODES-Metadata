"description": "Until version 3.6.0, all versions of netCDF employed only one binary data format, now referred to as netCDF classic format. NetCDF classic is the default format for all versions of netCDF. The classic file formats are now referring to the collection of CDF-1, 2 and 5 formats. Format consumed by NetCDF-Java CDM library functions. This is a place holder, more information is needed. In the classic netCDF data model, at most one dimension can have the unlimited length, which means variables can grow along that dimension. A netCDF classic dataset (including CDF-1, 2, and 5 formats) is stored as a single file comprising two parts: 1) a header, containing all the information about dimensions, attributes, and variables except for the variable data; 2) a data part, comprising fixed-size data, containing the data for variables that don't have an unlimited dimension; and variable-size data, containing the data for variables that have an unlimited dimension. Both the header and data parts are represented in a machine-independent form. This form is very similar to XDR (eXternal Data Representation, http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1832.txt), extended to support efficient storage of arrays of non-byte data.   The original netCDF format is identified using four bytes in the file header. All files in this format have 'CDF\\001' at the beginning of the file. In this documentation this format is referred to as CDF-1 format. NetCDF CDF-1 format is identical to the format used by every previous version of netCDF. It has maximum portability, and is still the default netCDF format.",

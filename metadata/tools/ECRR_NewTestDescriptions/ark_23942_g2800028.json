"description": "ISF messages comply with the IMS1.0 standard that was developed for  exchanging data used to monitor the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.  Thus, parsers that conform with the IMS1.0 standard will parse ISF messages without a fatal error, although they may ignore data in ISF extensions of IMS1.0.  In ISF, an important extension of IMS1.0 is a set of rules for formatting comments to exchange types of data that are not accommodated in IMS1.0. The objective of the ISF standard is to allow recipients to utilise the full set of parameters in each message with minimal risk of misinterpretation. It would be possible to write an IMS1.0 message with custom, free-form comments containing data for which ISF includes special-purpose formatted comments. Such a message would not violate any of the ISF rules. Nevertheless, such messages fail to meet the ISF objectives, and might be described as incompletely formatted.",

    "description": "Data Access Protocol (DAP) version 4.0 (referred to also as DAP4). This data transmission protocol is intended to supersede all previous versions of the DAP protocol. DAP4 is designed specifically for science data, but it is intended to be discipline neutral. The protocol relies on widely used and stable standards, and is capable of representing a wide variety of scientific data types. The DAP is a protocol for access to data organized as variables. It is particularly suited to accesses by a client computer to data stored on remote (server) computers that are networked to the client computer. DAP was designed to hide the implementation of different collections of data. The assumption is that a wide variety of data sets using a wide variety of data schemas can be translated into the DAP protocol for transmission from the server holding that dataset to a client computer for processing.  The DAP utilizes two responses to represent semantic structural description and data content of a data source. One response, called the DMR, returns metadata information describing the structure of a request for data. That is, it characterizes the variables, their datatypes, names and attributes. The second response, the Data Response, returns both the metadata about the request, but also the data that was requested. The DMR and the metadata part of the Data Response are represented using a specific XML representation. Operationally, communication between a DAP client and a DAP server uses some underlying already existing protocol, most typically HTTP.   There are two response formats that a server MUST provide to the client: 1) DMR-Only Response  contains  the DMAR as a standard XML encoded document.; 2) (DMR +) Data response -The DAP4 data response uses a format very similar to that used for DAP2; the data payload is broken into two pieces. The first part holds metadata describing the names and types of the variables in the response while the second part holds the values of those variables.",

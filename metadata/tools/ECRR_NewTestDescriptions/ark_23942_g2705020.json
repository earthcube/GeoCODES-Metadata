"description": "A grid has two components: 1) 64-word header describing the grid projection, grid directory, gridded variable, level parameter, time of the data, etc.; 2) Actual grid data, which is an n- by m-word matrix.  A grid file is a binary file, which may contain a user-defined maximum number of grids. By default, a grid file is created with the ability to store 159 grids unless otherwise specified. Grid file numbers can be between 1 and 999999. If a grid file number is five or six digits, the file name begins with only GRI or GR. For example, grid file number 12345 has the file name GRI12345, but grid file number 123456 has the file name GR123456. Grid files do not have to follow this standard naming convention. The file masking option of DSSERVE may be used to access a data file of any name through the ADDE. The word allocation for grid files is divided into several sections below. The grid file directory is described first, followed by the grid header. The first 33 words and words 40 through 64 of the grid header are the same for all grid types; however, words 34 to 39 are specific to a particular grid type. Format consumed by NetCDF-Java CDM library functions.",

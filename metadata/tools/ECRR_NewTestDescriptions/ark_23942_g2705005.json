"description": "Update to  Common Doppler Radar Exchange Format, generally referred to as Universal Format (UF) and introduced in 1980 (Barnes 1980), to account for radars on a fixed platform (e.g. ground-based radar), as well as for radars on a moving platform (airborne and ship-borne radars). Other design criteria include (1) To accommodate data from multiple radars or even data from multiple instruments (e.g. radar data and aircraft data). (2) To be efficient at keeping redundant header information to a minimum, and to implement a data compression scheme. (3)To be flexible for future expansion, without changing its basic structure. (4) To be flexible with recording media (e.g. 9-track or Exabyte). Files consist of a collection of blocks that may be user defined or defined in the spec. All blocks begin with four ASCII characters describing the block and then a 32-bit integer giving the length of the block in bytes. The lengths of all blocks or descriptors should be evenly divisible by 4. All floating point numbers follow the IEEE 32 bit floating point standard. All 4 byte numbers (floats or 32 bit integers) must begin on a boundary that is evenly divisible by 4. The use of place holders should be adopted to accomplish this. All integers should be in 'Big Endian' notation (the first byte is the most significant byte).  Format consumed by NetCDF-Java CDM library functions.",

"description": "SeedLink is a real-time data acquisition protocol and a client-server software that implements this protocol. The SeedLink protocol is based on TCP. All connections are initiated by the client. During handshaking phase the client can subscribe to specific stations and streams using simple commands in ASCII coding. When handshaking is completed, a stream of SeedLink 'packets' consisting of a 8-byte SeedLink header (containing the sequence number) followed by a 512-byte Mini-SEED record, is sent to the client. The packets of each individual station are always transferred in timely (FIFO) order. The SeedLink implementation used in SeisComP is the oldest and most widely used, however, other implementations exist. Another well-known implementation is deployed in IRIS DMC and some manufacturers have implemented SeedLink in their digitizer firmware. All implementations are generally compatible, but not all of them support the full SeedLink protocol. On the other hand IRIS DMC implements some extensions which are not supported by other servers. In the following we use 'SeedLink' to denote the SeedLink implementation used in SeisComP. The data source of a SeedLink server can be anything which is supported by a SeedLink plug-in - a small program that sends data to the SeedLink server. Plug-ins are controlled by the SeedLink server, e.g., a plug-in is automatically restarted if it crashes or a timeout occurs. Data supplied by a plug-in can be a form of Mini-SEED packets or just raw integer samples with accompanying timing information. In the latter case, the SeedLink server uses an integrated 'Stream Processor' to create the desired data streams and assemble Mini-SEED packets.",

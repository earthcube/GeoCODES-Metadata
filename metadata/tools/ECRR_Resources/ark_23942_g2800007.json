"description": "Walter Hobbs of the RAND Corporation wrote RDB, based on ideas from an article published in the March 1991 issue of Unix Review magazine ('A 4GL Language'), and from the book UNIX Relational Database Management, by Rod Manis, et. al. (Prentice Hall PTR/Sun Microsystems Press). The database is based on a  simple text format for tabular data that is now known as rdb. The data is contained in regular UNIX ASCII files, and can be manipulated by regular UNIX utilities such as ls, wc, mv, cp, cat, more, text editors, head, RCS, etc. Each file of data is in the form of a relation, or table, with rows and columns of information. The relation, or table structure, is achieved by separating the columns with ASCII TAB characters, and terminating the rows with an ASCII NEWLINE character. All rows in a file of data contain data separated by TAB characters and terminated with NEWLINE characters; therefore the data must not contain TAB characters. Each data file consists of zero or more comment lines starting with a sharp character, '#,' followed by a header consisting of two lines containing structure definition information used by the operators, and zero or more lines of data which are referred to as the body. A file of data, structured as defined above, is said to be an RDB table.",

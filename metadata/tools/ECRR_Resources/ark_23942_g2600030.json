"description": "PseudoNetCDF provides read, plot, and sometimes write capabilities for atmospheric science data formats. Provides a single abstract interface for many data formats that provide analysis and plotting capabilities. PseudoNetCDF abstracts many file formats using the NetCDF data/object model. PseudoNetCDF provides this same data interface for data formats from CAMx models, RACM2 box-model outputs, Kinetic Pre-Processor outputs, CMAQ box-model outputs, ICARTT formatted data  (ffi1001), GEOS-Chem Binary Punch/NetCDF files, and more.  PseudoNetCDF was originally developed to simplify interacting with CAMx (http://www.camx.com/) input/output files. CAMx is a multi-scale photochemical modeling system for gas and particulate air pollution.             PseudoNetCDF provides tools for converting CAMx I/O formats to NetCDF that can be read and processed by many other tools (e.g., nco, cdo, Panoply, ncview, NCL, etc). As a part of the conversion, it also offers many data processing options. PseudoNetCDF processes across dimensions (slicing and aggregating) and files (differencing, ratioing, etc), and can create arbitrary expressions. PseudoNetCDF relies on the power and simplicity of the NetCDF4 Python interface and can be called from the command line or in python scripts.  Installation instructions and examples are provided at the following link:  https://github.com/barronh/pseudonetcdf  PseudoNetCDF is developed and maintained by Dr. Barron Henderson",

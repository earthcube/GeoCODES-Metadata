"description": "Format consumed by NetCDF-Java CDM library functions. HDF5 has some features that will not be supported by netCDF-4, and will cause problems for interoperability: 1) HDF5 allows a Group to be both an ancestor and a descendant of another Group, creating cycles in the subgroup graph. HDF5 also permits multiple parents for a Group. In the netCDF-4 data model, Groups form a tree with no cycles, so each Group (except the top-level unnamed Group) has a unique parent; 2) HDF5 supports 'references' which are like pointers to objects and data regions within a file. The netCDF-4 data model omits references; 3) HDF5 supports some primitive types that are not included in the netCDF-4 data model, including H5T_TIME and H5T_BITFIELD; 4) HDF5 supports multiple names for data objects like Datasets (netCDF-4 variables) with no distinguished name. The netCDF-4 data model requires that each variable, attribute, dimension, and group have a single distinguished name; 5) HDF5 (like netCDF) supports scalar attributes, but netCDF-4 cannot read scalar HDF5 attributes (unless it is a string attribute). This limitation will be removed in a future release of netCDF.  Format consumed by NetCDF-Java CDM library functions.",

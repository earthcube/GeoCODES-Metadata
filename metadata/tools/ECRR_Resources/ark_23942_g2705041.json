"description": "Commonly known as UF, the Universal Format is formally known as the Common Doppler Radar Exchange Format.  UF was primarily designed for access via FORTRAN. A FORTRAN binary block holds the data for each ray (or beam). UF is composed exclusively from ASCII characters and 16-bit integer words. Floating point values are computed by applying scale factors and offsets to the integer values.  UF has some significant limitations. Field names are limited to 2 characters. For example, reflectivity is often referred to as ZH, or DZ, and radial velocity as VR, because the 2-character limitation prevents use of longer names such as DBZ or VEL. Also, the headers are limited in length, so that the metadata associated with more sophisticated radars cannot be accurately represented.  Neverthless, UF is still popular with many researchers, and much analysis code has been written for UF data. Format consumed by NetCDF-Java CDM library functions",

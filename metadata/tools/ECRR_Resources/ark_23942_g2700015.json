"description": "a common conceptual feature model for use in identification of features as typical features of the hydrology domain using established models and patterns in use in the Hydrology domain and endorsed by WMO and UNESCO such as those documented in the 'International Glossary of Hydrology'.  Scope: to facilitate data sharing within the hydrologic community of the WMO Member countries and to improve the quality of data products based on these data by defining hydrologic features to convey their identification through the data processing chain 'from measurement to hydrological information'. The model is narrowly focused on surface water hydrographic features. As such, nuances of waterbodies and storages such as glaciers, snowfields, and wetlands are left to future work. Additionally, temporal aspects of hydrologic features are not addressed in this standard and would be expected to be handled by implementations using HY_Features classes for feature identification. Finally, as this standard precedes expected encoding standards, implementation details, such as the structure and handling of feature identifiers are out of scope.",
